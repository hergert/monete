# Privacy Policy
INTRODUCTION
We, at Wings Lab Pte. Ltd. ("we," "us," or "our"), recognize the importance our users attach to the handling of their Personal Data (as defined below). This Privacy Policy outlines our data processing practices when visitors and users access our websites and services. We kindly urge you to carefully review this Privacy Policy. Should you have any inquiries, please feel free to reach out to us as specified in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy serves as a supplementary document and does not replace any prior consents you may have granted us regarding your Personal Data. Any consents provided in connection with this Privacy Policy add to any rights we hold under applicable law for the handling or processing of your Personal Data.
We retain the right to modify this Privacy Policy periodically. While you should regularly review this Privacy Policy to be informed of any revisions, we may also communicate updates via various means, including notices or alternative forms of communication, as deemed suitable, or as mandated by applicable law.
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
By engaging with us, submitting information to us, or enrolling in any of our products or services on our websites, you acknowledge and consent to our processing of your Personal Data. Such processing may be carried out by our authorized service providers, adhering to the manner and purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Should you disagree with any aspect of this Privacy Policy or find it discomforting, we advise you to cease access or use of our websites and services immediately.
COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
 1. "Personal Data" pertains to (a) data concerning an identified or identifiable natural person; or (b) data analogous to “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or related terms as defined in relevant data protection laws.
 2. The scope and kinds of Personal Data we gather and process hinge on the nature of your interactions with us. In general, the following categories are collected and processed:
 1. Account and profile information, including email addresses, passwords, and/or blockchain wallet addresses;
 2. Payment and transaction information, comprising credit/debit cardholder names, credit/debit card numbers, country, city, state, address, and/or blockchain wallet transactions. We might involve third-party vendors for payment information collection and processing;
 3. Contact information, encompassing usernames in third-party services like Telegram or Discord, first and last names, email addresses, professional titles, company names, and/or phone numbers;
 4. Technical information and usage data, such as site-related and statistical details about visitor arrivals, IP addresses potentially revealing approximate or precise locations, device information, clickstream data, time stamps, and particulars about how our websites and services are utilized. This information might be automatically recorded via server logs or cookies. Further details are provided in the Cookies section below;
 5. Marketing and communications data, involving preferences for receiving marketing communications from us, communication preferences, communication history with us, our service providers, or third parties; and/or
 6. Other information, including participation in contests, promotions, or surveys, along with photographs, videos, and/or audio recordings taken by us or our agents.
 3. We may also collect and process information from third-party sources, such as public records, social media platforms, and blockchain data related to records or transaction histories occurring on the applicable blockchain for a blockchain wallet address.
 4. Additionally, we may provide features that enable users to invite or refer friends or contacts to utilize our services. In such cases, we may collect Personal Data (e.g., contact details) about these invitees or referrals to facilitate outreach. We advise against referring individuals to us or sharing their Personal Data without proper authorization or consent.
 5. While tagging blockchain wallet addresses is intrinsic to our business, we refrain from employing user Personal Data (e.g., blockchain wallet addresses within account or profile information) to append or publish such labels or expose the identity of any natural person as the owner of a given blockchain wallet address. Furthermore, we take measures to ensure no inadvertent identification of blockchain wallet address owners occurs through our technical and organizational arrangements. Exceptions to this rule are limited, such as labeling high-profile public figures who have openly disclosed their blockchain wallet addresses. However, such exceptions account for a negligible percentage of the blockchain wallet address-associated information utilized to deliver our websites and services.

PURPOSES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
 1. Where permitted by applicable law, we process your Personal Data for the following purposes (which may apply even if you do not maintain or have terminated your account with us):
 1. Providing products and/or services you've purchased or requested, personalizing and customizing your service experience, which may involve recommending features or content based on your usage patterns, profile information, preferences, and other submitted data;
 2. Enhancing our products, services, processes, and business. This includes using technical, usage, aggregated, de-identified, and/or anonymized data to comprehend user behavior and market trends;
 3. Communication purposes, including notifying you about service matters, account updates, addressing your queries, requests, feedback, and suggestions, or sending you direct marketing communications or interest-based advertisements, in line with our legitimate interests or applicable law;
 4. Business operations management, encompassing internal policy adherence, records maintenance for tax purposes, incident and accident reporting, protection and enforcement of contractual and legal rights, and facilitating business asset transactions;
 5. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules, codes, or guidelines, and assisting law enforcement and investigations by relevant authorities;
 6. Facilitating account registration and transactions, which may involve verifying your blockchain wallet address or other methods;
 7. Linking relevant Personal Data for the listed purposes; and/or
 8. Any other purpose pertinent or reasonably necessary for the above.
 2. For specific products, services, or interactions, we might provide additional "just-in-time" disclosures or notify you specifically about other purposes for which we process your Personal Data. These notices may complement or clarify our privacy practices, offering you additional choices concerning how we process your Personal Data for those purposes.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA
Subject to applicable law, your Personal Data may be disclosed for the purposes mentioned above (when relevant) to entities or parties, whether located overseas or in Singapore:

Vendors, agents, service providers, and other entities we engage to deliver goods and services either independently or on our behalf in connection with the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Examples include payment processors, cloud service providers, analytics and search engine providers, marketing partners, and customer support;
 2. Business partners, investors, assignees, or transferees (actual or prospective) to facilitate business asset transactions, which may encompass mergers, acquisitions, debt, or asset sales;

# Advanced Centralized Exchange Liquidity
Welcome to the Advanced version of the Centralized Exchange Liquidity Dashboard. This enhanced tool provides deeper insights into market liquidity dynamics by aggregating data from multiple exchanges, empowering traders and analysts with comprehensive information to make informed decisions.

# 
1. Introduction
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#1-introduction)
Liquidity is a critical component of any financial market, reflecting the ease with which assets can be bought or sold without causing significant price movements. The Advanced Liquidity Dashboard offers enhanced analytics by aggregating data from multiple centralized exchanges and introducing two new metrics: **Orderbook Liquidity Delta** and **Orderbook Spread Distribution**. These features provide a nuanced view of market dynamics, helping users gauge the balance between buy and sell orders and understand how spreads vary over periods.
# 
2. Key Features
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#2-key-features)
## 
Aggregated Liquidity Data
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#aggregated-liquidity-data)
 * **Definition:** The dashboard aggregates liquidity data from multiple centralized exchanges, providing a comprehensive view of the market's overall liquidity landscape.
 * **Purpose:** By consolidating data from various sources, users can obtain a more accurate and holistic understanding of market conditions, minimizing the impact of anomalies or disparities present in individual exchanges.
 * **Visualization:** Aggregated data is seamlessly integrated into all liquidity metrics, ensuring that users benefit from a unified perspective across different trading platforms.

## 
Orderbook Liquidity Delta
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#orderbook-liquidity-delta)

 * **Definition:** The Liquidity Delta represents the net difference between bid and ask volumes in the aggregated orderbook. It is calculated as:

 * **Purpose:** This metric indicates the current pressure in the market—whether buying (positive delta) or selling (negative delta) dominates.
 * **Visualization:** Displayed as a dynamic chart that updates in real-time to reflect the ongoing shifts in market sentiment across all connected exchanges.

## 
Orderbook Spread Distribution
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#orderbook-spread-distribution)

 * **Definition:** This feature analyzes the distribution of the bid-ask spread over various timeframes using aggregated data, providing insights into market volatility and liquidity consistency.
 * **Purpose:** Understanding spread distribution helps traders assess the cost of executing trades and the potential for price slippage across different exchanges.
 * **Visualization:** Presented through histograms or line charts segmented by user-defined time intervals (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute), reflecting aggregated spread data.

* * *
# 
3. Interpreting the Data
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#3-interpreting-the-data)
## 
Understanding Liquidity Delta
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#understanding-liquidity-delta)
The **Orderbook Liquidity Delta** chart offers a snapshot of the market's buying and selling pressure based on aggregated data from multiple exchanges. A positive delta suggests more aggressive buying, while a negative delta indicates stronger selling activity.
**Example Interpretation:**
 * **Positive Delta:** Indicates that the cumulative bid volume across all aggregated exchanges exceeds the ask volume, potentially signaling upward price pressure.
 * **Negative Delta:** Suggests that the cumulative ask volume surpasses the bid volume across all exchanges, which may lead to downward price movement.

Important Note: While the delta provides an overview of market sentiment, it does not directly translate into trading signals due to factors like _**Market and Iceberg orders**_ that may not be fully reflected in the aggregated delta.
## 
Analyzing Spread Distribution
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#analyzing-spread-distribution)
The **Orderbook Spread Distribution** by Timeframes provides a detailed view of how the bid-ask spread behaves over different periods using aggregated data from multiple exchanges. A consistently narrow spread may indicate a highly liquid market, whereas a wide or fluctuating spread could point to volatility or lower liquidity.
**Example Interpretation:**
 * **Narrow Spread:** Lower transaction costs and higher liquidity across aggregated exchanges.
 * **Wide Spread:** Higher transaction costs and potential challenges in executing large orders without affecting the price across the market.

* * *
# 
4. Important Considerations
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#4-important-considerations)
While the **Orderbook Liquidity Delta** and aggregated data offer valuable insights into market sentiment, it's essential to understand their limitations:
 * **Current Pressure Indicator:** The delta chart reflects the present balance between buy and sell orders across aggregated exchanges but does not directly translate into trading signals.
 * **Positive Delta Caveat:** Even when the delta is positive (indicating more buy orders than sell orders), the price may not rise as expected. This discrepancy can occur due to:
 * **Market Orders:** Large market buy orders can consume available ask liquidity without necessarily leading to a sustained price increase.
 * **Iceberg Orders:** Hidden or iceberg orders, which conceal the true order size, can mask the actual supply and demand dynamics, leading to misleading delta readings.
 * **Data Aggregation Dynamics:** Aggregating data from multiple exchanges provides a broader market perspective but may also introduce complexities such as varying liquidity profiles and trading behaviors across different platforms.
 * **Dynamic Market Conditions:** Market conditions can change rapidly. It's crucial to combine delta analysis with other indicators and market intelligence for more accurate trading decisions.

# 
5. Conclusion
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/advanced-cex-liquidity#5-conclusion)
The **Advanced Centralized Exchange Liquidity** is a powerful tool designed to provide deeper insights into market liquidity and orderbook dynamics by aggregating data from multiple exchanges. By leveraging the **Orderbook Liquidity Delta** and **Orderbook Spread Distribution** , users can better understand the forces shaping price movements and optimize their trading strategies accordingly. However, always consider the inherent limitations of these metrics and use them in conjunction with a comprehensive analysis framework to enhance trading effectiveness.

(ii) Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.
(iii) Billing. By providing Wings Lab with a payment method, you (i) warrant and represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Wings Lab to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Wings Lab to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription of the Services. In addition, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.
(iv) Recurring Payments. When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Wings Lab by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or Wings Lab.
(v) Overage Partial Charge. Each package includes a certain number of Compute Units (CUs). In the event that your usage of the Services exceeds the data limit of your subscribed package, you will be subject to additional charges for the excess usage ("Overage Charges"). Such charges will be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the rates set forth in your subscription. Any partial or fractional excess usage will be rounded up to the nearest applicable unit and billed accordingly. Overage Charges will be automatically added to your next billing cycle and/or deducted from your prepaid credit. By continuing to use the Services after exceeding your data limit, you acknowledge and agree to these charges. If payment for Overage Charges fails, your access to the Services will be suspended within one (1) day. To resume access, you must settle the overdue payment. If the payment remains unresolved for one (3) day, your Account will be terminated.
(vi) Automatic Renewal. You may choose for Services to automatically renew at the end of a fixed service period. We will remind you by email, or other reasonable manner, before any Services renew for a new term, and notify you of any price changes in accordance with this Clause 2.3.2(viii). Once we have reminded you that you elected to automatically renew the Services, we may automatically renew your Services at the end of the current service period and charge you the then current price for the renewal term, unless you have chosen to cancel the Services as described below.
(vii) Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.
(viii) Price Changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.
(ix) Disputes and Chargebacks. Disputes regarding payments should be addressed directly with our support team at bds@birdeye.so. We will review and process all dispute claims within 15 business days; during this period, your Account will remain suspended pending resolution. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, any necessary adjustments will be made; otherwise, you will remain liable for all amounts and associated charges. Filing a chargeback with your payment provider without first contacting us may result in immediate suspension of your Account and any use of the Services. You acknowledge and agree that creating a new account to circumvent such suspension is strictly prohibited. In such event, Wings Lab has the right to terminate your use of the Services at any time with or without notice.

# Batch Token CU Cost
### 
Batch CU Cost
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/batch-token-cu-cost#batch-cu-cost)
**Formula:**
> Batch CU Cost = N^0.8 × Base CU Cost
where:
 * **N** : Number of tokens requested in the batch.
 * **Base CU Cost** : The CU unit cost of calling a single token using multiple url (different from CU cost of single url)
 * The `Batch CU cost` is rounded up to the nearest whole number (0 decimal).

### 
Example
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/batch-token-cu-cost#example)
Given the following API costs:
API Name | Endpoint | Base CU Cost 
---|---|--- 
Token Multi Price | `/defi/multi_price` | 5 
If we request **N = 10** tokens using `/defi/multi_price`, the cost would be:
> Multi_price_batch_CU_api_cost = 5^0.8 x 10 = 38
**Note** :
 * Using the batch API is always more cost-efficient than making multiple single API calls.
 * Users should consider purchasing a Business plan to access batch APIs.
 * The larger the N, the higher the discount rate, but each API has an `n_max` cap that users should be aware of.

### 
`n_max` Table for Each API
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/batch-token-cu-cost#n_max-table-for-each-api)
API Name | Endpoint | Base CU cost | n_max (Max Tokens per Batch) 
---|---|---|--- 
Price (Multiple) GET & POST | `/defi/multi_price` | 5 | 100 
Price - Volume (Multiple) | `/defi/price_volume/multi` | 15 | 50 
Token - Meta Data (Multiple) | `/defi/v3/token/meta-data/multiple` | 5 | 50 
Token - Trade Data (Multiple) | `/defi/v3/token/trade-data/multiple` | 15 | 20 
Token - Market Data (Multiple) | `/defi/v3/token/market-data/multiple` | 15 | 20 
Pair - Overview (Multiple) | `/defi/v3/pair/overview/multiple` | 20 | 20 
All time - Trades (Multiple) | `/defi/v3/all-time/trades/multiple` | 25 | 20 
Exit liquidity (Multiple) | `/defi/v3/token/exit-liquidity/multiple` | 30 | 50 
Price stats (Multiple) | `/defi/v3/price/stats/multiple` | 20 | 20 
Token - Holder List (Batch) | `/token/v1/holder/batch` | 50 | 500 
Wallet - PnL | `/wallet/v2/pnl/multiple` | 40 | 50 
Wallet - PNL summary (multiple) | `/wallet/v2/net-worth-summary/multiple` | 50 | 100

**Quick Notes**
 * All wallet APIs are currently in beta and support a low rate limit across all packages (limited to 5 requests per second and 75 requests per minute for all wallet products).
 * The LITE/ STARTER package can only access the multiple price API; all other "multiple" APIs are not accessible.
 * All other batch, multi/ multiple APIs are available exclusively for the BUSINESS package and higher.
 * Max Usage Per Month defines the maximum allowable usage for the package each month is 5 times of the included amount. If the auto-renewal for max usage is not activated, the user will be immediately suspended upon reaching the limit. To continue, the user must manually re-subscribe to the current package or upgrade to a higher package. Users can also enable the auto-renewal feature via the dashboard for uninterrupted data usage. This is essential to keep you informed of high usage and prevent unexpected payments.

# CU carry-over policy
Effective from 01-July-2025

CU Carry-Over Policy 
For prepaid plans with a duration of 6 months or longer, unused Compute Units (CUs) from any given month will be carried over and remain available throughout the full subscription term.
The total CU quota is cumulative over the entire prepaid period. 
There is no monthly reset or CU loss if usage is below the monthly allocation within the same subscription cycle.
However, unused CUs will not carry over to a new subscription cycle once the current term ends.
No overage charges apply—once the CU quota is fully used or the term ends, the plan will be renewed accordingly.
Example: 
A 12-month prepaid plan with 50M CUs/month provides 600M CUs in total. If only 30M are used in January, the remaining 570M CUs stay available until the plan ends. If 10M remain unused at the end of the 12-month term, they will expire and not carry over to the next cycle.
🔒 Carry-over only applies to prepaid plans of 6 months or longer. It does not apply to monthly billing or shorter-term subscriptions.

# 🧮 Dynamic Compute Unit Cost
## 
OHLCV v3 and OHLCV v3 - Pair
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/dynamic-cu-cost#ohlcv-v3-and-ohlcv-v3---pair)
The CU (compute unit) cost is dynamic based on the number of candles requested. This is an update from the previous fixed max of 100 candles per request, now supporting up to 5000 candles.
**💡 New CU Tiers**
Candle Count Range | CU Cost 
---|--- 
< 1000 | 60 
1000 - 2000 | 90 
2000 - 5000 | 120 

## 
Recent txs
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/dynamic-cu-cost#recent-txs)
The CU (compute unit) cost is dynamic based on the number of transactions returned. This is an update from the previous fixed max of 100 transactions per request, now supporting up to 500 transactions.
**💡 New CU Tiers**
Candle Count Range | CU Cost 
---|--- 
<= 100 | 25 
101 - 300 | 75 
301 - 500 | 125 
ℹ️ Example:
 * Requesting 90 transactions → 25 CU
 * Requesting 250 transactions → 75 CU
 * Requesting 490 transactions → 125 CU

This dynamic model offers flexibility while scaling with data needs. Please ensure your integration handles CU cost estimation accordingly.

# Dashboard - Security
The Security Dashboard in Birdeye Data Services (BDS) gives you full control over your API access, helping ensure secure and compliant usage. Here, you can generate and manage your authentication keys, define trusted IP addresses via whitelisting, and restrict unwanted access through blacklisting.
Whether you're a solo developer or part of a security-focused enterprise, this section is essential for protecting your data pipeline and managing usage policies effectively.

## 
1️⃣ Authentication Key Management
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/dashboard-security#1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-authentication-key-management)
 * Purpose: These keys are required to authenticate your API requests.
 * Action: Click “Generate key +” to create a new API key.
 * We have a small note that shows Total rate limit is set for your account

> Tip: Store your key securely—treat it like a password.
## 
2️⃣ Whitelist Configuration
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/dashboard-security#2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-whitelist-configuration)
 * Restrict API access to a predefined list of IP addresses.
 * Click “Add +” in the WhiteList section to input allowed IPs.
 * Ideal for environments with static IPs, internal tools, or corporate firewalls.

## 
3️⃣ Blacklist Configuration
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/dashboard-security#3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-blacklist-configuration)
 * Block specific IP addresses from accessing your APIs.
 * Click “Add +” in the BlackList section to input banned IPs.
 * Use this to respond to suspicious activity or unauthorized attempts.

## 
✅ Best Practices
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/dashboard-security#-best-practices)
 * Rotate authentication keys periodically.
 * Use whitelisting for production environments.
 * Monitor audit logs regularly (available in the Audit Logs section).
 * Never expose your API keys in frontend code or public repositories.

# Insights
The Insight page serves as a comprehensive hub for assessing the cryptocurrency market. It consolidates a variety of data points—ranging from total market capitalization, total value locked (TVL), and trading volume, to more advanced analytics like market sentiment trends, token screener tools, and visualized token performances. By blending key metrics with intuitive data visualization and analysis features, Insight helps users form a clearer picture of the entire crypto landscape.
# 
Overview of the Key Metrics
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#overview-of-the-key-metrics)
This section helps user navigate and interpret the most important data displayed on the Insight page. Whether you’re looking for a high-level market overview or diving into specific sectors, these features give you a clear, user-friendly snapshot of the crypto landscape.
## 
1. Market Trend
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#1-market-trend)
### 
Coin 360
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#coin-360)

 * What It Is: A heatmap highlighting the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, presented in an easy-to-scan visual format.
 * Why It Matters: Each token’s size reflects its market share, and color indicators quickly show price gains or losses—so you can instantly gauge the overall market sentiment.
 * Data Integrity: Only tokens officially listed on reputable sources (like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap) are included, helping you avoid spam or low-credibility projects.

### 
Bubble Chart
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#bubble-chart)

 * What It Is: Another visualization of the top 100 tokens by market cap, where each token is represented as a bubble.
 * How It Helps: The bubble size indicates market cap; color or position can show price movements or other metrics. This makes it easy to see which coins dominate the market and how they stack up against one another.
 * Filtering: Just like Coin 360, this chart excludes tokens not recognized by major market data sources.

### 
Native Token Performance
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#native-token-performance)

 * What It Covers: Shows how the main tokens of various blockchains (Layer 1s and Layer 2s) are performing over specific timeframes.
 * Why You Need It: If you’re comparing, for example, Ethereum vs. BNB Chain vs. newer chains, this section clarifies which ones are gaining or losing momentum in real time.

### 
Crypto Visual Screener
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#crypto-visual-screener)

 * What It Does: Offers an interactive, customizable way to filter and sort tokens based on metrics like trading volume, market cap, and price changes.
 * Why It’s Useful: Quickly pinpoint tokens experiencing significant price swings, large volume spikes, or any other notable trend—all in a single, user-friendly interface. This is especially helpful for spotting new opportunities or potential market shifts.

## 
2. Industries
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#2-industries)
### 
Overview of All Sectors
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/insights#overview-of-all-sectors)
 * Sector Heatmap

A color-coded snapshot of how each sector (e.g., DeFi, GameFi, NFTs) is performing, based on aggregated token data.
 * Historical Sector Dominance

How each sector’s share of total market cap, volume, or TVL has changed over time. This shows you which areas are growing or fading in influence.
 * A metric that summarizes sector performance, making it easy to compare at a glance—think of it like a quick score for each sector’s overall health.
 * Price Performance by Sector: Displays how many tokens in each sector have risen or fallen within a given timeframe, helping you spot sectors on the upswing or in decline.
 * All Sector Stats: An “at-a-glance” table of total market cap, TVL, and trading volume for every sector, along with their 24-hour changes.

# Market Data
Our platform provides comprehensive multi-market data for cryptocurrency tokens, pulling information from both decentralized exchanges (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX). This allows users to monitor and analyze token performance across different exchange types in real-time, providing a holistic view of the market landscape.
## 
Supported Decentralized Exchanges
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/market-data#supported-decentralized-exchanges)
Our platform aggregates data from a variety of decentralized exchanges (DEX). This includes information from leading DEXs operating across different blockchain ecosystems.
## 
Supported Centralized Exchanges
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/market-data#supported-centralized-exchanges)
In addition to the decentralized exchanges, our platform also provides real-time multi-market data for cryptocurrency tokens, supporting data from multiple top centralized exchanges (CEX). This allows users to track token prices, volume, and order books across several platforms in one place.
Here is a list of the currently supported centralized exchanges:
No | `Exchange` | `Address` 
---|---|--- 
1 | BINANCE | <https://www.binance.com/en> 
2 | BINANCE US | <https://www.binance.us/> 
3 | COINBASE | <https://www.coinbase.com/> 
4 | TOOBIT | <https://www.toobit.com/en-US> 
5 | GATE | <https://www.gate.io/> 
6 | BYBIT | <https://www.bybit.com/en/> 
7 | OKX | <https://www.okx.com/> 
8 | MEXC | <https://www.mexc.com/> 
9 | BINGX | <https://bingx.com/> 
We are continuously working to expand our list of supported exchanges to enhance market coverage.
#### 
CEX data concepts explanations
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/market-data#cex-data-concepts-explanations)

**Spread (%):** Absolute difference (%) between the best (lowest) ask price and the best (highest) bid price in the order book over average price
**Depth +1%** : refers to the cumulative volume of sell orders (asks) within 1% above the current market average price.
**Depth -1%** refers to the cumulative volume of buy orders (bids) within 1% below the current market average price.

# Overage Charge rule
## 
1. Stripe Users
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/overage-charge-rule#1-stripe-users)
For customers paying via Stripe, the overage charge policy is structured to handle excess usage effectively, ensuring service continuity while aligning charges with usage levels.
### 
Key Points:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/overage-charge-rule#key-points)
**Billing Cycle** : Overage charges are applied based on specific usage tiers, with higher included CU allowances permitting greater overage thresholds before additional charges are incurred.
**Overage** is a post-paid model that allows users to continue using data after their quota is used up, charged at a low overage cost.
When the overage amount reaches the **Partial Overage Charge** threshold (a predefined amount depending on the specified plan), the system will automatically charge to reset the post-paid allowance.
**Payment Failure Consequences:**
 * Suspended Access: If an overage payment fails, the user's access will be suspended within 1 day. To resume access, the user must settle the overdue payment.
 * Cancellation: If the payment remains unresolved for 3 days, the account will be canceled. After cancellation, the user must purchase a new package to regain access.

#### 
Usage Tiers:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/overage-charge-rule#usage-tiers)
Overage charges are calculated based on the following incremental tiers:
0–20 million CUs
20–50 million CUs
50–200 million CUs
200–500 million CUs
500–1,000 million CUs
1,000–2,000 million CUs
Above 2,000 million CUs
**Details**
Package | Partial overage charge each 
---|--- 
Lite | $100 
Starter | $100 
Premium | $100 
Business | $300 
This structure ensures fairness and transparency in billing, with charges aligned to usage levels and clear steps for users to restore or renew their service if payments fail.
## 
2. Crypto Users
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/overage-charge-rule#2-crypto-users)
For customers paying via cryptocurrency, overage charges are deducted from their prepaid credit, ensuring a smooth handling of excess usage:
 * **Prepaid System** : Crypto users pay for their package **3 months in advance**.
 * **Overage Deduction** : Overage usage beyond the included CU allowance is **deducted from the prepaid credit**.
 * **Renewal Requirement** : Once the prepaid credit is depleted, the user will be notified and required to **renew their payment** to continue using the service.

### 
Example
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/overage-charge-rule#example)
 * A crypto user with a **3-month prepaid plan** runs out of included CUs after 2 months.
 * The overage charges are deducted from the remaining credit.
 * Once the credit is depleted, the user will be notified and prompted to renew their plan.

This system ensures that crypto users manage overage charges within their prepaid plan, allowing them to continue service smoothly.
* * *
## 
Important Note
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/overage-charge-rule#important-note)
For a more convenient experience, users are encouraged to upgrade to a plan with a higher included usage allowance. This helps reduce the likelihood of overage charges and ensures smoother operations. Additionally, WebSocket data has a **different and separate overage charge**. For more information on WebSocket overage pricing, please contact the Birdeye team.

# SUBSCRIBE_BASE_QUOTE_PRICE
The "SUBSCRIBE_BASE_QUOTE_PRICE" event allows you to receive real-time updates about price changes for any token pairs without needing to input a specific pair address; you can simply pass the two token addresses you want to track. You can subscribe to price updates for these token pairs in the form of OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data. This subscription is useful for tracking price movements and trends on the Birdeye platform.
## 
Code Example
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_base_quote_price#code-example)
Check out this Github file for an example:
<https://github.com/TheNang2710/bds-public/blob/main/ws-base-quote.js>
## 
1. WebSocket URL:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_base_quote_price#1-websocket-url)
```
wss://public-api.birdeye.so/socket/solana?x-api-key=YOUR-API-KEY
```

### 
Header
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_base_quote_price#header)
Key | Value 
---|--- 
`Origin` | ws://public-api.birdeye.so 
`Sec-WebSocket-Origin` | ws://public-api.birdeye.so 
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` | echo-protocol 
## 
2. Subscribe to Base-Quote Price (OHLCV)
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_base_quote_price#2-subscribe-to-base-quote-price-ohlcv)
To receive real-time updates about price changes for a specific token pair in the form of OHLCV data, use the following subscription message format:
### 
Subscription message
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_base_quote_price#subscription-message)
json
```
{  
  "type": "SUBSCRIBE_BASE_QUOTE_PRICE",  
  "data": {  
    "baseAddress": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",  
    "quoteAddress": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",  
    "chartType": "1m"  
  }  
} 
```

### 
Sample response
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_base_quote_price#sample-response)
json
```
{  
  "type": "BASE_QUOTE_PRICE_DATA",  
  "data": {  
    "o": 153.00668789866964,  
    "h": 153.0229060481432,  
    "l": 152.88823226160142,  
    "c": 152.89094335479908,  
    "eventType": "ohlcv",  
    "type": "1m",  
    "unixTime": 1729158060,  
    "v": 0,  
    "baseAddress": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",  
    "quoteAddress": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"  
  }  
}
```

### 
Implementation Example in JavaScript
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_base_quote_price#implementation-example-in-javascript)
Use the above github js code and run
bash
```
node ws-base-quote.js solana So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v 1m
```

**Explanation:**
 * `solana`: The blockchain chain to subscribe to (e.g., Solana).
 * `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`: The base token address.
 * `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`: The quote token address (e.g., USDC).
 * `1m`: The chart type, which is the interval for OHLCV data (e.g., 1 minute).

**Note:**
 * This example subscribes to real-time price updates for a token pair and logs the Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data to the console. The subscription is automatically closed after 1 hour.
 * This WebSocket only support 1 base-quote pair for 1 connection. You need to open another connection for new base-quote subscription.

Subscribing to Real-Time Price Updates (SUBSCRIBE_PRICE)
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe-price#subscribing-to-real-time-price-updates-subscribe_price)
The "SUBSCRIBE_PRICE" event allows you to receive real-time updates about price changes for tokens or token pairs. You can subscribe to price updates for individual tokens, token pairs, or a combination of both. This subscription is useful for tracking price movements and trends on the Birdeye platform.
### 
WebSocket Price Updates
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe-price#websocket-price-updates)
Although the interval is **1 minute** (or any supported interval), price updates occur whenever a transaction affects the price, reflecting the new close price within the interval. However, the **aggregated price** is updated based on an internal **ranking pool mechanism** , meaning not every transaction results in a price change.
🔹 We recommend implementing **ping-pong checks and reconnection strategies** when using WebSockets to ensure a stable connection and accurate price updates.
You can use this Websocket to get real time price updates of following objects:
 * Token Price
 * Pair (Market Price)
 * Multiple Tokens/Pairs Price

The instructions for each type of objects are described below.
## 
Code Example
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe-price#code-example)

# 🔒 Security Data Glossary
camelCase for v1, v2. sanke_case for v3 and above for the same term
This document provides details on the security-related attributes of a token.
## 
📋 Token Security Data Fields
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/security-data#-token-security-data-fields)
Name | Type | Definition 
---|---|--- 
`ownerAddress` | String | The wallet address of the token's owner. If not `null`, the token can still be minted (`mintable = true`). If `null`, minting is no longer possible (`mintable = false`). 
`mutableMetadata` | Boolean | Indicates whether the token's metadata can be modified. If `true`, metadata updates are allowed (`mutable = true`). If `false`, metadata is locked (`mutable = false`). 
`renounced` | Boolean | Derived from `ownerAddress`. If `ownerAddress == null`, the token has been **renounced** (`renounced = true`), meaning the owner has given up control and further minting is impossible. 
`freezeAuthority` | Address | The account address with authority to freeze the token 
`freezeable` | Boolean | Indicates whether the token can be frozen.
 * Checked via `freezeAuthority`.
 * Returns **`false`**if`freezeAuthority` is `null` or `11111111111111111111111111111111`.

`isToken2022` | Boolean | Indicates whether the token follows the **Token2022** standard. 
`transferFeeEnable` | Boolean | Specifies whether `token2022` transfer fees are enabled.
 * If `null` or `false`: transfer fees are not enabled.

`transferFeeData` | | Contains transfer fee details (e.g., fee amount, epoch, maxFee, etc.). 
`nonTransferable` | Boolean | Indicates whether token can be transferred.
 * If `false` or `null`, the token is **transferable**.

# Security Check
The Security Check feature ensures that users are aware of potential risks associated with tokens by evaluating them against a set of security criteria. Each criterion is carefully designed to highlight aspects that may indicate a token’s safety or risks.
## 
How to Use
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/security#how-to-use)
 1. Go to a specific token page
 2. 
Navigate to the Security tab under the main chart.
 3. 
Review the security report
 4. Click on the tooltip next to each criterion for more information about the issue or check the **Security Criteria Table** below

## 
Security Criteria
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/security#security-criteria)
**Criteria** | **Description** | Severity | Type | Solution 
---|---|---|---|--- 
**Fake Token** | This token is either a scam or imitation of another token. | Critical | Token Info | 
 * 

**Ownership Renounced** | Token's owner can adjust token parameters such as minting, token name, logo, website, etc. | Critical | Token Info | The current owner of token must transfer their owner ship to a `NULL address` . 
Or set the Mint Authority and Freeze Authority as `disable` while using CLI at the creation for Solana tokens. 
**Honeypot** | If a token is Honeypot, very high chance it is a scam. Buyers may not be able to sell this token, or the token contains malicious code. | Critical | Token Info | 
 * 

**Freezable** | Token SPL V2 element - the authority can freeze every token from transferring among wallets. | Critical | Token Extension | Freeze Authority 
**Freeze Authority** | Freeze Authority is who can freeze every token from transferring among wallets. | Critical | Token Extension | Change Freeze Authority to Null address or just disable freeze authority at the creation of token. 
**Jupiter Strict List** | If a token is in Strict List, it was verified by Jupiter's community. | High Risk | Community | <https://station.jup.ag/guides/general/get-your-token-on-jupiter#getting-on-the-strict-list> 
**Top Holders Percentage** | If a token has high top 10 holder percentage, there are risks of those holders mass selling and make the token's price volatile. | High Risk | Community | Reduce the proportion of total token supply holdings within top 10 wallets. 
**Token Percentage of Owner** | The percentage of tokens held by the token owner. | High Risk | Dev | Reduce the proportion of total token supply holding in Owner Address. 
**UA Percentage** | The percentage of tokens held by the token Update Authority. | High Risk | Dev | Reduce the proportion of total token supply holding in Update Authority Address. 
**Buy Tax** | Transfer fee will cause the actual value received when transfer a token to be less than expected, and high transfer fee may lead to large losses. | High Risk | Token Extension | 
 * 

**Sell Tax** | Transfer fee will cause the actual value received when transfer a token to be less than expected, and high transfer fee may lead to large losses. | High Risk | Token Extension | 
 * 

**Max Fee** | The maximum fee that the authority can charge on each transfer. | High Risk | Token Extension | 
 * 

**Transfer Fees** | Token SPL V2 element - the authority can charge a percentage fee when this token is transferred among wallets. | High Risk | Token Extension | 
 * 

**Transfer Fee Config Authority** | Config Authority is who can change the transfer fee anywhere from 0 to Max fee. | High Risk | Token Extension | Change the Transfer Fee Config Authority to NULL address. 
**Mintable** | Mint function enables contract owner to issue more tokens and cause the coin price to plummet. It is extremely risky. | High Risk | Token Info | Change Mint Authority to Null wallet or just disable mint authority at the creation of token. 
**Mutable Info** | The token information such as name, logo, website can be changed by the owner. | Medium Risk | Token Info | 
 * Change Update Authority to Null wallet or just disable at the creation of token.

**First Mint Time** | The token is first minted at this time. There can be several other mint events after this. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**First Mint Tx** | The token is first minted at this transaction. There can be several other mint events after this. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**Creator Address** | The token creator's address. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**Creator Balance** | The token balance of token creator. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**Owner Address** | Ownership is mostly used to adjust the parameters and status of the token, such as minting, token name, logo, website, etc. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**Owner Balance** | The token current owner's address. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**UA Balance** | The token balance of token Update Authority. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**Update Authority (UA)** | The token's update authority address. | Neutral | Dev | 
 * 

**Liquidity Burned** | When a part of token liquidity is burnt, that part can never be traded in the open market. | Neutral | Liquidity | 
 * 

**Liquidity Locked** | When a part of token liquidity is locked, that part can not be transacted in the open market, which reduce the risks of mass selling. However those tokens can be unlocked in the future. | Neutral | Liquidity | 
 * 

**LP Holders Count** | The total number of liquidity providers on this token in multiple markets. The more LPs there are, the more decentralized the token becomes. Only count from the most liquid pool | Neutral | Liquidity | 
 * 

**Fee Withdrawer** | Withdrawer is who can withraw all the transfer fees to a wallet of their choice. | Neutral | Token Extension | 
 * 

**Current Transfer Fees** | The authority can charge a percentage fee when this token is transfered among wallets. | Neutral | Token Extension | 
 * 

## 
Interpreting the Results
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/security#interpreting-the-results)
 * Pass: The token satisfies the criterion with no significant risks detected.
 * Warning: A potential risk is detected. Click the tooltip for more information.
 * Fail: The token fails the criterion and poses significant security concerns.

## 
❗ Disclaimer
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/security#-disclaimer)
The Security Check feature is a tool to assist in evaluating token security. It is not a guarantee of safety or investment performance. Users should conduct their own due diligence and consult professionals before making investment decisions.

# Scaled UI Amount Extension
Under Development
# 
Overview
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#overview)
The Scaled UI Amount extension is a new feature introduced in the Solana Token 2022 Program. This extension allows token creators to give their assets stock-like behavior — supporting splits and visual adjustments in token quantity and price without actual on-chain transfers. Birdeye has added comprehensive support for this to ensure both transparency and usability while maintaining data accuracy and stability.
# 
🧠 Core Concepts
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#-core-concepts)
## 
What Is Scaled UI Amount?
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#what-is-scaled-ui-amount)
 * Scaled UI Amount introduces "shares" as a unit derived from the base token amount via a multiplier.
 * Think of it like a stock split — your wallet still holds the same economic value, but shows more tokens ("shares").
 * Underlying asset: Consider the real token (on-chain) as the base asset.
 * Derived asset: Shares, or the visual token amount, adjusted for display and user reference.

## 
🔍 How Birdeye Handles Scaled UI Amount
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#-how-birdeye-handles-scaled-ui-amount)
### 
General Philosophy
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#general-philosophy)
 * Birdeye treats Scaled tokens as derivatives of the base asset.
 * We default to showing raw on-chain data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
 * However, scaled metrics are displayed alongside to help users interpret data more intuitively.

## 
📄 Token Detail Page Changes
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#-token-detail-page-changes)
### 
1. Recent Trades Table
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#1-recent-trades-table)
 * ✅ Raw Mode (Default)
 * Amount: On-chain amount
 * Price: On-chain execution price
 * 🆕 Scaled Mode (Toggle Option)
 * Amount: Amount * Multiplier
 * Price: Price / Multiplier

_Users can switch between Raw and Scaled views using a toggle switch._
### 
2. Candlestick Chart
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#2-candlestick-chart)
 * ✅ Default: Uses raw price and raw amount for consistency with market data.
 * 🆕 Toggle to Scaled Mode:
 * Prices and amounts shown as "shares"
 * Each data point is scaled using the current multiplier

### 
3. Supply Stats
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#3-supply-stats)
 * Total Supply: Always shown in raw (base token) amount.
 * Circulating Supply: Always shown in raw amount.

_This maintains alignment with on-chain explorers and official tokenomics._
### 
4. New Fields on Token Stats Panel
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#4-new-fields-on-token-stats-panel)
Field | Description 
---|--- 
Shares per Token (SPT) | Also known as the multiplier, this indicates how many shares equal one raw token. 
Share Price | Computed as: `Raw Price / Multiplier`. This shows what each "share" would cost. 

## 
🧩 New “Extensions” Tab
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#-new-extensions-tab)
This is a dedicated section to explain and visualize Scaled UI logic for tokens that support it.
### 
Included Components:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#included-components)
 1. Price Comparison Chart
 * Shows both Raw Price and Scaled (Share) Price over time.
 * Helps users understand how scaling affects perception of value.
 2. Multiplier History Chart
 * Interactive timeline of all multiplier updates.
 * Useful to trace events like stock-like splits or supply expansions.
 3. Essential Info Panel

Field | Description 
---|--- 
Current Multiplier | How much each raw token is multiplied to get shares 
Last Updated | Timestamp of most recent multiplier update 
UI Scaled Supply | Total shares in circulation 
Original Token Address | Links to on-chain explorer 
Program Version | Confirms if Token 2022 features are supported 

# 
🔚 Summary
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/scaled-ui-amount-extension#-summary)
| 
---|--- 
Raw Token | Scaled UI (Shares) 
On-chain reality | UI-only transformation 
Stable, auditable | User-friendly display 
Trading based | 

Birdeye’s UI provides tools to toggle, analyze, and visualize both raw and scaled views so users can make informed decisions without losing touch with reality.

# Rate Limiting
Birdeye Data Services (BDS) provides powerful APIs for accessing and analyzing data. To ensure fair usage and maintain system stability, BDS implements rate limiting.
# 
Per User Account Rate Limit
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/rate-limiting#per-user-account-rate-limit)
BDS applies a rate limit at the user account level. This rate limit dictates the total number of requests that can be made across all APIs associated with a user account within a specified time frame. Birdeye's data APIs are designed to cater to users with varying needs, and as such, we offer different tiers of access with corresponding rate limits. This page outlines the rate limits for each tier: Free, Premium, Business, and Enterprise. View details for each tiers below.
> 📘
> ### 
> Your Rate Limit is Per User Account
> [](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/rate-limiting#your-rate-limit-is-per-user-account)
> It's important to note that the actual rate limit that is applied when you use BDS APIs is **PER ACCOUNT** rather than per individual API. This means that the rate limit applies to the total number of requests made across all APIs associated with your Birdeye Data Services account.
Tier | API Endpoints Access | Rate Limit per account (rps/ rpm ) 
---|---|--- 
**Standard** | Limited to 3 specific endpoints. Details. | 1 rps 
**Lite** | Full set of all APIs available. Details | 15 rps 
**Starter** | Full set of all APIs available. Details | 15 rps 
**Premium** | Full set of all APIs available. Details | 50 rps/ 1000 rpm 
**Business** | Full set of APIs available. Details 
Websocket Access Available | 100 rps/ 1500 rpm 
**Enterprise** | Tailored to the specific needs of the enterprise. | Custom 
*rps: requests per second
*rpm: requests per minute
* * *
# 
Per API Rate Limit
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/rate-limiting#per-api-rate-limit)
For most APIs within Birdeye Data Services, a very high limit is applied and our clients can query as much as their user account rate limit allows. However there are some exceptions for the heavier APIs that have lower rate limit:
### 
**Wallet API Group**
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/rate-limiting#wallet-api-group)
It's important to note that endpoints belonging to the Wallet API group have a different rate limit due to their sensitive nature and potential for high-frequency updates. The rate limit for endpoints within the Wallet API group is set to **30 requests per minute (rpm)**. This stricter rate limit helps to mitigate excessive traffic and maintain optimal performance for these critical endpoints.
These endpoints include:
No. | API | Description | Endpoint | Rate Limit (rpm) 
---|---|---|---|--- 
1 | List of Supported Chains | Provides a list of supported blockchains that are available for wallet integration through the Birdeye APIs. | <https://docs.birdeye.so/reference/get_v1-wallet-list-supported-chain> | 30 
2 | Wallet - Portfolio - Selected Chain | Access detailed information about a user's portfolio, including current holdings, transaction history, and performance metrics. | <https://docs.birdeye.so/reference/get_v1-wallet-token-list> | 30 
3 | Wallet - Portfolio - Multichain | Retrieve portfolio data across multiple blockchain networks, providing a comprehensive view of the user's assets. | <https://docs.birdeye.so/reference/get_v1-wallet-multichain-token-list> | 30 
4 | Wallet - Token Balance | Check wallet's balance of a specific token. | <https://docs.birdeye.so/reference/get_v1-wallet-token-balance> | 30 
5 | Wallet - Transaction List - Selected Chain | Retrieve portfolio data of a wallet in a specific blockchain network, providing a comprehensive view of the user's assets. | <https://docs.birdeye.so/reference/get_v1-wallet-tx-list> | 30 
6 | Wallet - Transaction List - Multichain | Access a consolidated transaction history that spans various blockchain networks, providing users with a comprehensive record of their multichain activities. | <https://docs.birdeye.so/reference/get_v1-wallet-multichain-tx-list> | 30 
7 | Transaction Simulation | Retrieve a preview of transactions for users to check before they finalize and sign the transaction. | <https://docs.birdeye.so/reference/post_v1-wallet-simulate> | 30 
* * *
# 
Managing Rate Limits:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/rate-limiting#managing-rate-limits)
To ensure optimal performance and prevent exceeding your rate limit, consider the following best practices:
 * **Monitor Usage:** Keep track of your API usage to stay within your allotted rate limit. Monitoring tools and dashboards can help you track usage patterns and identify any potential issues.
 * **Prioritize Requests:** Prioritize your API requests based on their importance and frequency. Allocate resources efficiently to ensure critical operations are not hindered by rate limits.
 * **Implement Backoff Strategies:** Implement backoff strategies to gracefully handle rate limit exceeded errors. This may include implementing exponential backoff or retry-after mechanisms to retry failed requests after a delay.
 * **Upgrade Packages:** If you consistently find yourself hitting the rate limit of your current package, consider upgrading to a higher-tier package with a higher rate limit to accommodate your growing needs.

By understanding and effectively managing the rate limits associated with Birdeye Data Services packages, you can optimize your usage of our APIs and unlock the full potential of our data-driven solutions.
* * *
# 
Usage Guidelines
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/rate-limiting#usage-guidelines)
**API Key Requirement:** All tiers require an API key for authentication. Details
**Rate Limit Enforcement:** Adhering to the specified rate limits is essential to ensure fair usage and optimal performance for all users.
**Upgrade Options:** Users interested in higher tiers with expanded features can upgrade their subscription through the Birdeye dashboard.
**Enterprise Customization:** Enterprises seeking specialized data access and rate limits can reach out to our sales team for personalized solutions.

Subscribing to Real-Time Token Transaction Updates (SUBSCRIBE_TXS)
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#subscribing-to-real-time-token-transaction-updates-subscribe_txs)
The "SUBSCRIBE_TXS" event allows you to receive real-time updates about token transactions. You can subscribe to transactions for individual tokens, token pairs, or a combination of both. This subscription is useful for tracking trading activities and other relevant transactions on the Birdeye platform.
You can use this Websocket to get real time transaction updates of following objects:
 * Transactions of a token
 * Transactions of a pair/market
 * Transactions of multiple Tokens/Pairs

You can also filter the transaction type for each object, including swap, add liquidity, and remove liquidity. The instructions for each type of objects are described below.
## 
Code Example
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#code-example)
Checkout this Github file for an example:
> <https://github.com/birdeye-so/tradingview-example-js-api/blob/main/websocket_example.js>
## 
1 - Subscribe Token Transactions
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#1---subscribe-token-transactions)
To receive real-time updates about transactions for a specific token, you can use the following subscription message format:
### 
Input
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#input)
JSON
```
{
    "type": "SUBSCRIBE_TXS",
    "data": {
        "queryType": "simple",
        "address": "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN",
				"txsType": "all"
    }
}
```

You can pass any of the following values to `txsType`: "all", "add_remove_liquidity", "add_liquidity", "remove_liquidity", "swap" to filter transaction types. If `txsType` is not provided, the result will default to returning all transaction types, the same as when using "all".
###

## 
2 - Subscribe Pair Transactions
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#2---subscribe-pair-transactions)
To receive real-time updates about transactions for a specific token pair, you can use the following subscription message format:
### 
Input
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#input-1)
JSON
```
{
    "type": "SUBSCRIBE_TXS",
    "data": {
       "queryType": "simple",
     	 "pairAddress": "842NwDnKYcfMRWAYqsD3hoTWXKKMi28gVABtmaupFcnS",
			 "txsType":"all"
    }
}
```

You can pass any of the following values to `txsType`: "all", "add_remove_liquidity", "add_liquidity", "remove_liquidity", "swap" to filter transaction types. If `txsType` is not provided, the result will default to returning all transaction types, the same as when using "all".
### 
Output Example
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#output-example-1)

}
```

## 
3 - Subscribe to Multiple Addresses (Limit 100)
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#3---subscribe-to-multiple-addresses-limit-100)
You can also subscribe to transactions for multiple addresses by using the "complex" query type.
You can get updates for maximum 100 addresses at once.
The following example demonstrates how to subscribe to transactions for either a specific token address or a specific token pair address:
### 
Input
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#input-2)
JSON
```
{
    "type": "SUBSCRIBE_TXS",
    "data": {
        "queryType": "complex",
        "query": "address = So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 OR pairAddress = FmKAfMMnxRMaqG1c4emgA4AhaThi4LQ4m2A12hwoTibb",
				"txsType":"all"
    }
}
```

You can pass any of the following values to `txsType`: "all", "add_remove_liquidity", "add_liquidity", "remove_liquidity", "swap" to filter transaction types. If `txsType` is not provided, the result will default to returning all transaction types, the same as when using "all".
**Output**
JSON
```
{
    "type": "TXS_DATA",
    "data": {
        "blockUnixTime": 1692205532,
        "owner": "EkZStqj9BSwLS19uLDEsErCW6N1HHzvoGg92Ei3YYBNt",
        "source": "marinade",
        "txHash": "3GqVQTaimS2QsprgjTvpV4ArdZGUjoiacDE5Hy3baLapvAXekya7EsNjhWvMVbqdMRaJanwwAd4Bi9h8ag58vK3",
        ...
    }
}
```

The two WebSocket messages differ in their subscription type (complex vs simple), and as a result, there are key differences in the structure of the resulting **TXS_DATA** responses.
#### 
Request Type Difference
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#request-type-difference)
**First WebSocket Request (COMPLEX Query)**
```
{
    "type": "SUBSCRIBE_TXS",
    "data": {
        "queryType": "complex",
        "query": "address = 0x539bdE0d7Dbd336b79148AA742883198BBF60342 OR address = 0x2f2a2543B76A4166549F7aaB2e75Bef0aefC5B0f",
				"txsType":"all"
    }
}
```

**Query** :
 * Logical OR statement, tracking multiple addresses.
 * Returns all transactions involving these addresses, including swap, add liquidity and remove liquidity.

**Second WebSocket Request (SIMPLE Query)**
```
{
    "type": "SUBSCRIBE_TXS",
    "data": {
        "queryType": "simple",
        "address": "0x539bdE0d7Dbd336b79148AA742883198BBF60342"
				"txsType":"all"
    }
}
```

**Query** :
 * Tracks only this specific address.
 * Optimized for this token address being a main asset in the transaction.

#### 
Response Structural Differences
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#response-structural-differences)
Field | COMPLEX Response | SIMPLE response 
---|---|--- 
side | swap | buy / sell 
tokenAddress | ❌ | ✅ 
pricePair | ❌ | ✅ 
priceMark / tokenPrice | ✅ | ❌ 
#### 
Contextual Interpretation
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/subscribe_txs#contextual-interpretation)
**COMPLEX** query is more general and is probably used for monitoring addresses (wallets or token contracts) regardless of their transaction role. It yields raw swap data and doesn't include enriched metadata like tokenAddress, pricePair, or network. 
**Example:**
```
{  
    "type": "TXS_DATA",
    "data": {
        "blockUnixTime": 1750298427,

On Solana, a valid address is required (e.g., 9SeRj4LjgENeKQujfxRNkGbXYPM3X2vr9C37Jg9AARfg).
A single connection supports querying multiple token addresses in one request, with a maximum of 100 addresses per call. (e.g., `"address": ["So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112" , "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN" , "2zMMhcVQEXDtdE6vsFS7S7D5oUodfJHE8vd1gnBouauv"`] )

 1. You can find a description of our Services on our Website.
 2. The following payment terms shall apply to your purchase of any Service and you agree to be bound by them.
 * **Charges.** If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes, unless stated otherwise. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.
 * **Your Billing Account.** To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.
 * **Billing.** By providing Wings Lab with a payment method, you (i) warrant and represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Wings Lab to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Wings Lab to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription of the Services. In addition, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.
 * **Recurring Payments.** When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Wings Lab by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or Wings Lab.
 * **Overage Partial Charge.** Each package includes a certain number of Compute Units (CUs). In the event that your usage of the Services exceeds the data limit of your subscribed package, you will be subject to additional charges for the excess usage ("Overage Charges"). Such charges will be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the rates set forth in your subscription. Any partial or fractional excess usage will be rounded up to the nearest applicable unit and billed accordingly. Overage Charges will be automatically added to your next billing cycle and/or deducted from your prepaid credit. By continuing to use the Services after exceeding your data limit, you acknowledge and agree to these charges. If payment for Overage Charges fails, your access to the Services will be suspended within one (1) day. To resume access, you must settle the overdue payment. If the payment remains unresolved for one (3) day, your Account will be terminated.
 * **Automatic Renewal.** You may choose for Services to automatically renew at the end of a fixed service period. We will remind you by email, or other reasonable manner, before any Services renew for a new term, and notify you of any price changes in accordance with this Clause 2.3.2(viii). Once we have reminded you that you elected to automatically renew the Services, we may automatically renew your Services at the end of the current service period and charge you the then current price for the renewal term, unless you have chosen to cancel the Services as described below.
 * **Refund Policy.** Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.
 * **Price Changes.** We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.
 * **Disputes and Chargebacks.** Disputes regarding payments should be addressed directly with our support team at bds@birdeye.so. We will review and process all dispute claims within 15 business days; during this period, your Account will remain suspended pending resolution. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, any necessary adjustments will be made; otherwise, you will remain liable for all amounts and associated charges. Filing a chargeback with your payment provider without first contacting us may result in immediate suspension of your Account and any use of the Services. You acknowledge and agree that creating a new account to circumvent such suspension is strictly prohibited. In such event, Wings Lab has the right to terminate your use of the Services at any time with or without notice.
 * **Payment Failure.** If a payment attempt fails due to any reason, your subscription and access to the Services may be temporarily suspended until the issue is resolved. Users are responsible for ensuring valid and up-to-date payment methods are available to avoid service disruptions. Users acknowledge that failure to maintain a valid payment method is their sole responsibility, and Wings Lab has no obligation to restore access once an Account is suspended due to non-payment. Repeated payment failures may result in permanent suspension of your Account or restrictions on future purchases.

# Wallet Integration
Instructions for Wallet Providers to Integrate Their Wallets into Birdeye
# 
Key Concepts to Know
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#key-concepts-to-know)
**Wallet Adapter:** This is an open-source library that provides components and APIs to integrate cryptocurrency wallets into blockchain applications (dApps). It simplifies the process for developers by allowing them to add wallet support to their applications without having to write code from scratch for each wallet.
**Connector (EVM)/Adapter (Solana)** : This refers to the specific code written for each wallet type according to the interface and conventions of the Wallet Adapter. Wallet providers must provide this code for Birdeye to integrate the wallet into our UI.
* * *
# 
How to Integrate a Wallet into Birdeye
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#how-to-integrate-a-wallet-into-birdeye)
## 
Wallets on Solana
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#wallets-on-solana)
### 
Using the Solana Wallet Adapter library
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#using-the-solana-wallet-adapter-library)
 * **Wallets withSolana Wallet Standard Implementation**: If your wallet has implemented the Solana Wallet Standard and the user has installed the wallet, the Wallet Adapter will automatically detect and display your wallet in the "Connect Wallet" section. _**No additional integration work is required from your side.**_
 * **Wallets withoutSolana Wallet Adapter Integration**: If your wallet has not integrated the Solana Wallet Adapter, you will need to **write an adapter** for the Solana Wallet Adapter to enable integration into Birdeye. Contact us after you have these details ready.

* * *
## 
Wallets on EVM Compatible Blockchains
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#wallets-on-evm-compatible-blockchains)
For example: Ethererum, BNB SmartChain, Polygon, etc.
### 
Using the wagmi (v1) library:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#using-the-wagmi-v1-library)
**Providing a Connector**: If your wallet wants to integrate into Birdeye, you need to provide a Connector for wagmi (v1) specific to your wallet. For example, to integrate Coinbase on EVM, use the Connector written by Coinbase for wagmi (v1).
_Note that EVM does not yet have a standard Wallet Standard like Solana or Sui._
* * *
## 
Wallets on Sui
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#wallets-on-sui)
### 
Using the wallet-kit library:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/wallet-integration#using-the-wallet-kit-library)
**Wallets with Sui Wallet Standard Implementation** : Sui has its own Sui Wallet Standard. If your wallet has implemented the Sui Wallet Standard and the user has installed the wallet, the Wallet Adapter (wallet-kit) will automatically detect and display your wallet in the "Connect Wallet" section. _**No additional integration work is required from your side.**_
* * *
By following these guidelines, you can efficiently integrate your cryptocurrency wallets into Birdeye, leveraging the standardized libraries and conventions provided by Wallet Adapters. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team.

# Third-party Swap Function
To bring the best user experience to our users, Birdeye integrates with Jupiter, a decentralized exchange protocol. This integration allows users to seamlessly exchange cryptocurrencies directly within the Birdeye platform.
## 
Integration with Jupiter:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/third-party-swap-function#integration-with-jupiter)
Birdeye.so leverages Jupiter's decentralized exchange protocol to enable smooth and secure swapping of cryptocurrencies. By integrating with Jupiter, Birdeye ensures that swapping transactions occur directly on the decentralized exchange, providing users with decentralized and transparent trading experiences.
## 
Decentralized Swaps:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/third-party-swap-function#decentralized-swaps)
It's important to note that all swapping transactions initiated through Birdeye.so are executed on Jupiter's decentralized exchange. Birdeye does not intervene in the swapping process, allowing for trustless and censorship-resistant transactions directly between users.
## 
Processing Fee:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/third-party-swap-function#processing-fee)
Please be aware that a processing fee of 0.6% is applied to all trades conducted through Birdeye.so. This fee covers the costs associated with infrastructure, development, and maintenance for the website.
## 
Disclaimer:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/third-party-swap-function#disclaimer)
> 🚧
> ### 
> Birdeye is NOT responsible for any funds lost when users trade non-reputable tokens or engage in swaps by mistakes. Additionally, Birdeye is not responsible for processing the swap itself, as the swap occurs on Jupiter's programs on-chain. Users are encouraged to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging in any trading activities.
> [](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/third-party-swap-function#birdeye-is-not-responsible-for-any-funds-lost-when-users-trade-non-reputable-tokens-or-engage-in-swaps-by-mistakes-additionally-birdeye-is-not-responsible-for-processing-the-swap-itself-as-the-swap-occurs-on-jupiters-programs-on-chain-users-are-encouraged-to-exercise-caution-and-conduct-thorough-research-before-engaging-in-any-trading-activities)
## 
How to Swap:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/third-party-swap-function#how-to-swap)
To initiate a swap, simply navigate to the swapping function within the Birdeye.so platform. Select the cryptocurrencies you wish to exchange, enter the desired amount, and confirm the transaction. Your swap will be executed directly on Jupiter's decentralized exchange, with the resulting assets deposited into your designated wallet.
## 
Important Considerations:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/third-party-swap-function#important-considerations)
 * Ensure that you have sufficient funds in your wallet to cover the transaction amount, including any applicable processing fees.
 * Double-check the details of your swap before confirming to avoid any errors or discrepancies.
 * Please note that swapping transactions are irreversible once confirmed, so exercise caution when initiating trades.

# WebSocket metrics
Link: <https://bds.birdeye.so/user/metrics>
Metric | Description 
---|--- 
**Data Types Over Time** | The number of subscriptions for each WebSocket type used over time, representing the data types at the moment the WebSocket connection is initiated, which is also when the user subscribes to that data type. 
**Data Size (byte)** | The number of bytes received, helping you track the data volume handled by each subscription type. 
**CU Usage (CU)** | The metric shows your current compute usage, calculated by multiplying the Compute Unit Per Byte (CUPB) by the number of bytes received. With this metric, you can better understand your compute usage and optimize resource allocation. 
**Active Connections** | The line chart shows the number of total unique connections at any given time, providing a clearer understanding of the connection load on your system.

Birdeye Real-Time WebSocket Documentation
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#birdeye-real-time-websocket-documentation)
## 
Introduction
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#introduction)
The **Birdeye Real-Time WebSocket** provides real-time updates for cryptocurrency-related events, including **price changes, transactions, OHLCV data, and wallet activity**. This documentation outlines how to connect, subscribe to events, and receive live data updates.
### 
Connection Limits
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#connection-limits)
Each WebSocket **connection** supports:
 * **Price, Transactions, and OHLCV:** Up to **100 tokens per connection**
 * **Wallet Tracking:** **1 address per connection**

WebSocket access is available for **Business Package** subscribers, which includes **500 concurrent connections** by default. For higher limits, consider upgrading to the **Enterprise Package** for more concurrent connections.
# 
Supported Timeframes
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#supported-timeframes)
We support a wide range of timeframes for all chains via the WebSocket API, ranging from 1 minute to 1 month: `1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1H, 2H, 4H, 6H, 8H, 12H, 1D, 3D, 1W, 1M` For Solana, we also support additional smaller intervals: `1s, 15s, 30s` These timeframes can be used in your subscription requests to receive candlestick data at the desired granularity.
## 
Code Example
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#code-example)
Checkout this Github file for an example: <https://github.com/birdeye-so/tradingview-example-js-api/blob/main/websocket_example.js#L62-L65>
Sample for new-pair on javascript <https://github.com/TheNang2710/bds-public/blob/main/new-pair-simple.js>
Sample code for ohlcv on Go <https://github.com/TheNang2710/bds-public/blob/main/go/ws_price.go>
## 
WebSocket URL:
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#websocket-url)
```
wss://public-api.birdeye.so/socket/solana?x-api-key=YOUR-API-KEY
```

### 
Header
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#header)

---|--- 
`Origin` | ws://public-api.birdeye.so 
`Sec-WebSocket-Origin` | ws://public-api.birdeye.so 
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` | echo-protocol 
**Note:**
 * Replace `<chain>` with the desired blockchain identifier (e.g., `solana` for the Solana blockchain, ethereum for the Ethereum blockchain) and `<api_key>` with your Birdeye API key.
 * Add `echo-protocol` to your request header.

## 
Subscription and Unsubscription
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#subscription-and-unsubscription)
To receive real-time updates, you need to subscribe to specific events using subscription messages. The example code above demonstrates how to send a subscription message to receive price updates for a specific currency pair.
## 
Supported WebSocket Events
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#supported-websocket-events)
Birdeye Real-Time WebSocket supports the following subscription types:
### 
**Subscription Events**
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#subscription-events)
**Subscription Type** | **Description** 
---|--- 
`SUBSCRIBE_PRICE` | Subscribe to receive real-time price updates for tokens or token pairs. 
`SUBSCRIBE_BASE_QUOTE_PRICE` | Subscribe to receive real-time updates about price changes for any token pairs without needing to input a specific pair address 
`SUBSCRIBE_TXS` | Subscribe to receive real-time transaction updates for tokens or token pairs. 
`SUBSCRIBE_TOKEN_NEW_LISTING` | Subscribe to real-time updates about new token listings. 
`SUBSCRIBE_NEW_PAIR` | Subscribe to receive real-time updates about new pairs.

   type: "UNSUBSCRIBE_TXS"
}
```

## 
Connection Instructions
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#connection-instructions)
To establish a WebSocket connection to the Birdeye Real-Time API, you can use various WebSocket client libraries available for different programming languages.
Here's an example using Node.js:
JavaScript
```
const WebSocketClient = require('websocket').client;
const util = require("util");

const client = new WebSocketClient();

client.on('connectFailed', function (error) {
    console.log('Connect Error: ' + error.toString());
});

client.on('connect', function (connection) {
    console.log('WebSocket Client Connected');

    connection.on('error', function (error) {
        console.log("Connection Error: " + error.toString());
    });

    connection.on('close', function () {
        console.log('WebSocket Connection Closed');
    });

    connection.on('message', function (message) {
        if (message.type === 'utf8') {
            console.log("Received: '" + message.utf8Data + "'");
            // Process received data here
        }
    });

    // Send subscription message here
    const subscriptionMsg = {
        type: "SUBSCRIBE_PRICE",
        data: {
            chartType: "1m",
            currency: "pair",
            address: "FmKAfMMnxRMaqG1c4emgA4AhaThi4LQ4m2A12hwoTibb"
        }
    };

    connection.send(JSON.stringify(subscriptionMsg));
});

// Connect to Birdeye WebSocket
client.connect(util.format('wss://public-api.birdeye.so/socket/<chain>?x-api-key=<api_key>'), 'echo-protocol', "https://birdeye.so");
```

## 
Message Format
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#message-format)
WebSocket messages are exchanged in **JSON format** , consisting of:
 * **`type`**: Specifies the subscription type (e.g.,`"SUBSCRIBE_PRICE"`).
 * **`data`**: Contains the relevant subscription details.

* * *
## 
Real-Time Data
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#real-time-data)
Once subscribed, real-time updates are received in **JSON format** , containing relevant information based on the subscribed event. The structure of the response varies depending on the event type.
* * *
## 
Error Handling
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#error-handling)
WebSocket connections may encounter **errors** due to network instability, API limits, or invalid requests. To ensure smooth operation:
 * **Monitor error events** and handle them gracefully.
 * **Implement automatic reconnection** in case of connection failures.

* * *
## 
Closing & Reconnecting
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#closing--reconnecting)
To properly close a WebSocket connection, ensure a **graceful shutdown**. If the connection is lost unexpectedly, implement a **reconnection mechanism** to restore subscriptions automatically.
Recommended **reconnection strategy** :
 * **Use exponential backoff** to manage reconnection attempts.
 * **Verify network connectivity** before retrying.
 * **Re-subscribe to previous events** upon reconnection.

* * *
## 
Security Considerations
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#security-considerations)
 * **Keep API keys secure** and avoid exposing them in public repositories or front-end code.
 * **Use environment variables** to store sensitive credentials.
 * **Monitor WebSocket usage** to detect unauthorized access.

## 
Connection Stability: Ping-Pong and Reconnection Strategy
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/websocket#connection-stability-ping-pong-and-reconnection-strategy)
To ensure long-lived and reliable WebSocket connections—especially for streaming real-time price updates—we recommend implementing a ping-pong mechanism alongside a reconnection strategy.
WebSocket connections can silently drop due to network issues, timeouts, or intermediate proxies. A heartbeat system using ping-pong messages helps detect these drops and recover gracefully.
🔁 Implementing Ping-Pong Birdeye WebSocket servers support standard WebSocket ping/pong frames.
**Client-Side (Example in JavaScript):**
JavaScript
```
const WebSocketClient = require('websocket').client;
const util = require("util");

const client = new WebSocketClient();

client.on('connectFailed', function (error) {
    console.log('Connect Error: ' + error.toString());
});

client.on('connect', function (connection) {
    connection.on('error', function (error) {
        console.log("Connection Error: " + error.toString());
    });

    connection.on('close', function () {
        console.log('WebSocket Connection Closed');
    });

    connection.on('message', function (message) {
        if (message.type === 'utf8') {
            console.log("Received: '" + message.utf8Data + "'");
            // Process received data here
        }
    });

    connection.on('ping', function () {
        connection.pong()
    });

    // Send subscription message here
    const subscriptionMsg = {
        type: "SUBSCRIBE_PRICE",
        data: {
            chartType: "1m",
            currency: "pair",
            address: "FmKAfMMnxRMaqG1c4emgA4AhaThi4LQ4m2A12hwoTibb"
        }
    };

    connection.send(JSON.stringify(subscriptionMsg));
});

// Connect to Birdeye WebSocket
const chain = "solana"; // Example chain
const apiKey = "<your_api_key_here>";
const wsUrl = util.format('wss://public-api.birdeye.so/socket/%s?x-api-key=%s', chain, apiKey);

client.connect(wsUrl, 'echo-protocol', "https://birdeye.so");
```

Notes:
 * The server may also initiate pings. Make sure your client responds with a pong automatically or manually, depending on the WebSocket library you’re using.
 * Adjust ping intervals based on your latency tolerance and expected traffic volume.
 * Always clear timeouts and intervals when closing or reconnecting.

# How Backpack Wallet delivered Day-1 real-time trading on Monad with Birdeye API
At Monad mainnet launch, Backpack Wallet shipped a production-ready trading experience – powered by a real-time onchain data layer built with Birdeye.

!How Backpack Wallet delivered Day-1 real-time trading on Monad with Birdeye API
When a new network launches, user expectations don’t reset to “beta.” In an ecosystem-native wallet, every interaction leads to a real onchain action — discovering new tokens, swapping into emerging assets, or participating in early market activity. Users expect speed, clarity, and confidence from the first interaction.
For Backpack Wallet’s Monad mainnet launch, that meant shipping **action-ready experiences from Day 1** : fast token discovery, accurate real-time pricing, responsive charts, and trustworthy token context — all critical as new assets and liquidity rapidly emerged.
To meet that bar on a tight launch timeline, Backpack partnered with Birdeye as a core component of its real-time onchain data layer.
### The challenge — shipping trading-grade UX at network launch
Monad’s mainnet launch was a key ecosystem moment for Backpack. With QA and code-freeze deadlines approaching, the wallet needed to support **real economic activity immediately** , not incremental enablement post-launch.
Backpack planned to use Birdeye’s APIs for most trading-related functionality inside the wallet. This included:
 * Discovering newly launched and trending tokens
 * Powering zero-fee in-wallet swaps with accurate pricing and liquidity context
 * Rendering responsive charts as markets formed
 * Giving users enough information to act confidently during volatile early conditions

Early network launches are inherently dynamic. Token metadata evolves quickly, liquidity shifts rapidly, and incomplete or delayed data can undermine user confidence — particularly when users are swapping or trading newly launched assets.
For the Monad mainnet launch, Backpack also rolled out a dedicated in-wallet launch campaign and collaborated closely with Monad-native token launchpads such as Nad.fun, further increasing early onchain activity and raising the bar for real-time, reliable data. Backpack required an onchain data provider that could support real-time updates, fast integration, and production reliability from Day 1.
### The solution — real-time data powering swaps, discovery, and markets
Backpack has built its reputation as a trading-first wallet in the Solana ecosystem, where real-time data is table stakes. To extend that same standard to Monad, Backpack mapped its core trading experiences directly to Birdeye’s onchain data infrastructure.
Key integrations included:
 * **Real-time multi-token pricing and liquidity** , allowing Backpack to keep token lists current as new assets and liquidity emerged during launch
 * **Token overview and metadata** , providing traders with market signals such as volume, liquidity, buy/sell activity, market capitalization, and supply
 * **Historical price data** , enabling responsive in-wallet charting by timestamp
 * **Trending token discovery** , surfacing where trading activity was concentrating across short-term time windows

To accelerate time-to-market, Birdeye enabled Monad support on its existing API infrastructure. This allowed Backpack to integrate, test, and validate using familiar endpoints — without waiting for separate tooling or environments — helping the team meet launch timelines with confidence.
### The outcome — **a smoother Day-1 trading experience**
With Birdeye integrated into its onchain data layer, Backpack delivered a smoother and more confident Day-1 trading experience on Monad: real-time pricing and liquidity, responsive charting, and token pages that matched trader expectations — even during an incentive-driven launch period.
Throughout the launch process, Birdeye worked closely with Backpack to support integration questions and trending-token updates as the ecosystem evolved. The collaboration reflects a shared focus on shipping production-ready trading experiences, even as new networks come online.
> _“Birdeye plays an important role in Backpack’s onchain data layer. Their API provides reliable token information across multiple networks, enabling real-time pricing and insights within Backpack Wallet. The integration has been smooth, and their team is always quick to support.”_ — Armani Ferrante, Founder & CEO, Backpack
### Looking ahead
Following the Monad launch, Backpack plans to continue expanding its real-time data infrastructure as it supports additional networks and trading experiences. With a production-grade onchain data layer in place, Backpack is positioned to ship launch-day-ready trading experiences without compromising speed, accuracy, or user trust.

# Birdeye Data Services Now Supports Monad Mainnet
To support developers from day one, Birdeye is excited to announce full coverage of Monad trading data across 39 REST APIs and 7 WebSocket types.

!Birdeye Data Services Now Supports Monad Mainnet
Monad is preparing to launch its highly anticipated mainnet on Monday, November 24, introducing a high-performance, parallelized EVM environment designed for speed and scale. To support developers from day one, Birdeye Data Services (BDS) is excited to announce full coverage of Monad trading data across **39 REST APIs** and **7 WebSocket types**.
Builders integrating with Monad can now access real-time token, trade, liquidity, and market data through the same reliable infrastructure already powering products on Solana, Sui, Base, Ethereum, and more.
## What BDS Supports on Monad
At mainnet launch, BDS provides a complete suite of APIs and streaming endpoints for Monad, enabling developers to build dashboards, trading bots, explorers, analytics tools, and DeFi applications without waiting for additional infra.
### REST APIs (39 Supported)
 * DeFi – Price
 * All Time Trades (Multiple)
 * All Time Trades (Single)
 * Price – Multiple
 * Price – Historical
 * Trades – Token
 * Trades – Pair
 * OHLCV
 * OHLCV (V3)
 * OHLCV – Pair
 * OHLCV – Base/Quote
 * Token – List (V1)
 * Token – Overview
 * Token – All Market List
 * Price Volume – Multi
 * Price Volume – Single
 * Token – Trending List
 * Token – Top Traders
 * Token – New Listing
 * Token – Market Data (Multiple)
 * Token – Market Data (Single)
 * Token – Metadata (Multiple)
 * Token – Metadata (Single)
 * Token – Trade Data (Multiple)

 * Price Stats (Multiple)

 * Token – List (V3)
 * Token – List (V3) Scroll

This coverage ensures that projects can pull accurate real-time and historical data from a unified, chain-agnostic interface.
## WebSocket Coverage (7 Types)
Developers building real-time apps on Monad can access:
 * SUBSCRIBE_PRICE
 * SUBSCRIBE_TXS
 * SUBSCRIBE_BASE_QUOTE_PRICE
 * SUBSCRIBE_TOKEN_NEW_LISTING
 * SUBSCRIBE_NEW_PAIR
 * SUBSCRIBE_LARGE_TRADE_TXS
 * SUBSCRIBE_WALLET_TXS

These WebSockets deliver low-latency streams ideal for live dashboards, HFT bots, trading terminals, and alert systems.
## Why This Matters for Builders
Monad’s architecture unlocks high throughput through parallelized execution, and BDS complements that by providing fast, consistent, and scalable market data. With full support at launch, teams can:
 * Build instantly without waiting for indexers
 * Use consistent response formats across chains
 * Power both real-time and historical analytics
 * Deploy trading or portfolio applications from day one

BDS ensures data won’t be a bottleneck as Monad’s activity grows.

# Filter, Analyze, and Discover Token Activity with Trades by Volume (V3)
New API Trades – Transactions by Volume (V3) builds on Trades – Token (V3) API, adding volume-based filtering and an unlimited time range for deeper, more flexible analysis.
2 min 
read
!Filter, Analyze, and Discover Token Activity with Trades by Volume \(V3\)
Understanding what drives token movement requires more than just tracking transactions; it means knowing which trades actually matter. With Trades – Transactions by Volume (V3), Birdeye Data Services gives developers the ability to filter token trades by size, timeframe, and currency type to uncover meaningful activity on Solana.
This new version builds on Trades – Token (V3), adding volume-based filtering and an unlimited time range for deeper, more flexible analysis of token behavior and market dynamics.
## What’s New
The Trades – Transactions by Volume (V3) API returns a list of trades for a specified token, now with full control over trade size and filtering criteria. You can define:
 * **`min_volume`**and**`max_volume`**to isolate trades within your desired range
 * **`volume_type`**to choose between USD or token amount
 * **`limit`**to query up to 500 trades per request

Unlike the previous version, this API supports unlimited time ranges, enabling both real-time and historical volume analysis at scale.
## Why It Matters
Trade volume tells the real story behind market activity. Whether you are identifying whale movements, tracking trading momentum, or detecting sudden liquidity surges, Trades by Volume (V3) delivers the precision needed to focus on significant trades instead of noise.
With this endpoint, developers can:
 * Detect abnormal spikes in trading activity
 * Focus on large trades that move markets
 * Identify volume trends for token health and liquidity research

## Start Building Today
Using it is simple: send a GET request to `/defi/v3/trades/token-by-volume` with your target token. Add `**min_volume**`and`**max_volume**`to set your trade range, choose`**volume_type**`as either`usd` or `token_amount`, and get up to 500 trades in one call — complete with full trade details and timestamps.

!Black Friday 4-in-1 Special Offers: Biggest Promotion of the Year
This year, Birdeye Data Services is closing 2025 with our most comprehensive upgrade yet. Starting **28 November** , we are launching **Black Friday Special Offers** , a 4-in-1 program designed to give every developer more value across every tier of BDS.
One part of the program runs for one month (the 30% discount), while the other three upgrades are long-term improvements that will continue beyond the campaign window.
## 1. 30% Off All Paid Plans for New Users (28 Nov – 28 Dec Only)
During this one-month period, all new paid users receive **30% off** their **first month**.
 * Lite: $39 → $27.3
 * Starter: $99 → $69.3
 * Premium: $199 → $139.3
 * Premium Plus: $250 → $175
 * Business: $699 → $489.3 

The subscription renews at standard pricing from the second month onward. **No refund** will be made for discounted purchases. This limited-time offer gives teams a low-commitment way to explore higher tiers at a reduced cost.
## 2. Up to 67% More Compute Units Across Paid Plans 
In addition to the seasonal discount, we are increasing Compute Unit allowances across all paid plans. These expanded CU limits will remain in place **after** the Black Friday period.
New CU allowances:
 * Starter: 3M → 5M CUs
 * Premium: 10M → 15M CUs 
 * Premium Plus: 15M → 20M CUs 
 * Business: 70M → 100M CUs 

These increases allow developers to test larger workloads, handle more traffic, and scale faster without hitting compute ceilings. Usage increase will be applied to your **upcoming billing cycle**.
## 3. Introducing the Lite Plan 
We are also launching **Lite** , a new entry plan created for smaller projects and lightweight use cases. This plan will remain available after the campaign.
**Lite Plan**
 * Price: $39/month (will be $27.3 for the first month during the one-month Black Friday Special Offers)
 * CU: 1.5M
 * Rate limit: 15 RPS

Ideal for students, early prototypes, small personal projects, and builders who want to explore BDS at the lowest price point.
## 4. Standard Plan Expansion to 48 APIs
The Standard (Free) plan now includes **48 APIs** , up from 21. This represents a long-term expansion of the free tier and is available beyond the one-month campaign.
The upgrade gives more builders access to core API coverage across tokens, trades, pricing, OHLCV, and wallet data — making it possible to build meaningful prototypes without upgrading immediately.
## The Complete 4-in-1 Program at a Glance
Four improvements launched together, but only one is time-limited:
 1. **30% off** all paid plans for new users (28 Nov – 28 Dec only)
 2. **Up to 67% more compute units** across paid plans 
 3. **New Lite plan** for smaller-scale and trial builds 
 4. **Standard plan expanded** from 21 → 48 APIs 

A seasonal discount plus three lasting upgrades to strengthen the BDS ecosystem moving forward.
## Build More with BDS This Season
Whether you are scaling production workloads or testing your first idea, Black Friday Special Offers make this the best moment to upgrade, explore, and expand with BDS.
The discount period runs from **28 November to 28 December** , so grab your chance now!

# Fogo Data APIs Are Now Live on Birdeye Data Services
Birdeye Data Services now supports Fogo APIs with 30+ endpoints for price, OHLCV, trades, transactions, and market lists – built for dashboards, bots, explorers, and DeFi apps. WebSockets coming soon.

!Fogo Data APIs Are Now Live on Birdeye Data Services
Birdeye Data Services now supports Fogo APIs, giving builders a fast way to pull trading-grade onchain data for dashboards, bots, explorers, analytics, and DeFi apps.
Instead of spinning up and maintaining your own indexing stack, you can plug into BDS and get normalized data through a single interface, so your product logic stays clean even as you scale across chains.
**Release date:** January 12, 2026
**Note:** WebSocket support for Fogo is coming soon.
### What BDS Supports on Fogo
Fogo apps tend to be latency-sensitive: traders want live updates, bots need reliable triggers, and analytics tools can’t lag behind market moves. With this release, BDS provides the building blocks you need to ship those experiences on Fogo today.
#### Fogo REST APIs (Available Now)
BDS supports 30+ Fogo endpoints, covering the most-used market and activity data surfaces:
 * Price & OHLCV for tokens and pairs (incl. base/quote candles)
 * Token overview + metadata
 * Trade + market data, including derived metrics such as price change and volume change
 * Transactions across multiple views: 
 * by token
 * by pair
 * by trader
 * by time range
 * by latest block
 * Market lists and ecosystem routing surfaces: 
 * trending tokens
 * top traders
 * other ranking lists used for discovery and monitoring

This is enough to power:
 * token pages and charting
 * “what’s moving” dashboards
 * trader leaderboards
 * bot logic that reacts to trades / flows
 * monitoring and alert systems

Start building on Fogo with Birdeye Price API
#### Fogo WebSocket Streaming (Coming Soon)
REST coverage gets you live products quickly, but for real-time trading UX and bot triggers, streaming matters.
WebSocket support for Fogo will be released soon, enabling low-latency feeds for live dashboards, alerts, and automated strategies.
Once it’s live, we’ll publish supported subscription types and payload formats in the WebSocket docs.
### Why This Matters
If you’re building on a performance chain like Fogo, your product can’t be held back by the data layer.
BDS helps teams:
 * ship faster without building custom indexing infra
 * keep integrations simple with a chain-agnostic API design
 * rely on consistent formats across endpoints (easier analytics + multi-chain expansion)
 * scale data consumption as usage ramps up

### Start Building on Fogo
 1. Get an API key via the BDS dashboard
 2. Call REST endpoints with your API key and set the chain to `Fogo`

# Fetch Better Wallet Token Balance with Token Balance V2 API
Introducing Wallet Token Balance v2 API — the newest and most complete way to fetch token balances from Solana wallets.
2 min

!Fetch Better Wallet Token Balance with Token Balance V2 API
Introducing Wallet Token Balance v2 API — the newest and most complete way to fetch token balances from Solana wallets.

This upgraded endpoint is designed to replace the older Wallet Token Balance (beta), offering more structured outputs and better compatibility with other wallet APIs like Wallet Current Net Worth (which should replace the older Wallet Portfolio beta).
## What It Does
The Wallet Token Balance v2 API returns a full snapshot of a wallet’s token balances, including:
 * Human-readable token amounts (no more manual decimal calculations)
 * USD value of each token held
 * Raw balances in base units
 * Rich token metadata (symbol, name, address, decimals, etc.)

This gives developers clean, reliable data to display portfolio breakdowns without stitching together multiple data sources.
## How to Use It
You can query any Solana wallet and retrieve balances for a list of tokens all at once.
Because the output includes formatted amounts, USD values, and token metadata, it pairs perfectly with the Wallet Current Net Worth API to build full portfolio views — from balance overviews to net worth summaries — without extra calculation or processing.
We recommend using Wallet Token Balance v2 in place of Wallet Token Balance (beta) going forward.
## Start Building Today
Wallet Token Balance v2 is live now and ready to power your Solana wallet features.

# Birdeye Data Services Now Supports Aptos Data API and WebSockets
Birdeye Data Services now provides real-time and historical Aptos blockchain data via REST APIs and WebSockets, enabling dashboards, trading bots, analytics tools, and DeFi apps.
3 min

!Birdeye Data Services Now Supports Aptos Data API and WebSockets
Birdeye Data Services (BDS) now supports Aptos across both REST APIs and real-time WebSocket streams. Builders can ship Aptos dashboards, trading bots, explorers, analytics products, and DeFi applications without waiting on extra indexing infrastructure.
With this release, Aptos developers get the same BDS experience teams already rely on across other supported chains: fast, normalized, production-grade blockchain data, delivered through a chain-agnostic data API.
### What BDS Supports on Aptos
BDS provides a complete Aptos data API suite, covering the primitives most applications need from day one.
#### Aptos REST APIs
Use BDS REST APIs to power:
 * Real-time token pricing (single + batch)
 * Historical pricing
 * OHLCV candles (token, pair, base/quote)
 * Trades & transaction feeds (token-level, pair-level, filtered views)
 * All-time and historical trade data
 * Derived trade metrics (price change, volume change over time)
 * Token discovery & search (token lists, filtering, search)
 * Token metadata & overviews (symbol, name, decimals, market stats)
 * Pair & liquidity context for DEX markets

This setup supports everything from a simple Aptos token price page to a full-featured Aptos trading terminal, without stitching together multiple data providers.
#### Aptos WebSocket Streaming
For low-latency and real-time use cases, BDS WebSockets stream live Aptos events including:
 * Live price / OHLCV updates
 * Real-time trades / tx updates
 * Base-quote price streams
 * New pair signals
 * Large trade tracking
 * Wallet activity streams

If you’re building alerts, trading bots, real-time dashboards, or onchain monitoring tools, this is the backbone.
### **Why This Matters for Builders**
Aptos is designed for high throughput and low latency, using a pipelined execution model and parallel transaction processing (Block-STM). While this architecture unlocks strong onchain performance, applications still depend on clean, real-time Aptos data to fully leverage that speed.
BDS complements Aptos by providing:
 * Reliable Aptos market data coverage without maintaining custom indexers
 * Consistent API response formats across chains, simplifying multi-chain deployments
 * Unified access to historical and real-time blockchain data
 * Infrastructure that scales as Aptos ecosystem activity grows

### Start building on Aptos
 1. Get an API key: Log in to the BDS dashboard, generate your key, and you’re ready.
 2. Query Aptos via REST (example): Use existing BDS endpoints and set the chain header to `aptos` to access Aptos token and market data.
 3. Stream Aptos via WebSocket (example): Connect to the BDS WebSocket and subscribe to the Aptos stream types you need.

# 2025 Year in Review: Powering Internet Capital Markets with Birdeye Data Services
In 2025, Birdeye Data Services (BDS) scaled its onchain data infrastructure to support builders, teams, and institutions operating across the crypto stack. From granular market data to wallet-level intelligence and Day-1 chain readiness, BDS became a foundational layer behind many of the fastest-moving crypto products today.

!2025 Year in Review: Powering Internet Capital Markets with Birdeye Data Services
Empowering Internet Capital Markets takes more than charts.
It takes infrastructure that is real-time, reliable, and production-ready, built not just for demos but for real users, real capital, and real market pressure.
In 2025, **Birdeye Data Services (BDS)** scaled its onchain data infrastructure to support builders, teams, and institutions operating across the crypto stack. From granular market data to wallet-level intelligence and Day-1 chain readiness, BDS became a foundational layer behind many of the fastest-moving crypto products today.
This is what we shipped.
### BDS in 2025: By the Numbers
By the end of 2025, Birdeye Data Services had grown into a widely adopted data layer for onchain markets:
 * **10,000+** builders and teams actively using BDS
 * 74 APIs and 8 WebSocket streams live as of December 2025
 * Coverage across Solana, Sui, and major EVM networks

Behind every “instant” trading interface, analytics dashboard, or onchain application is data that needs to be accurate, fast, and consistently available. BDS is built to be that layer.
### Wallet Data, Made Production-Ready
Wallet data is foundational to onchain analytics — but historically, it has been fragmented, slow, and difficult to operationalize at scale.
In 2025, BDS shipped a full suite of **wallet-grade APIs on Solana** , enabling teams to build robust wallet intelligence into their products:
 * PnL and performance tracking
 * Balance change and net worth analysis
 * Portfolio-level breakdowns

These APIs power trader dashboards, wallet analytics tools, and institutional reporting, delivering accurate, structured wallet data without teams having to build and maintain complex indexing pipelines themselves.
### Granular, Real-Time Market Data
Market data only becomes alpha when it is **granular and real time**. Throughout 2025, BDS expanded its market and DeFi data surface to support high-frequency use cases and deeper analysis:
 * OHLCV data at 1s, 15s, and 30s intervals (via both REST APIs and WebSockets)
 * Real-time token stats APIs and streams
 * All-time trades APIs for deep historical analysis
 * Meme token lists and detailed metadata across Solana, BNB Chain, and Monad

The result: lower latency, higher signal, and data that can actually keep up with fast-moving onchain markets.
### Day-1 Chain Readiness: Monad Mainnet
When new networks launch, data cannot lag behind.
For the **Monad mainnet** , Birdeye Data Services shipped **on day one** , providing builders with immediate access to a full data surface:
 * 39 REST APIs
 * 7 WebSocket types

Live from block one, BDS ensured that teams could ship trading interfaces, analytics, and tooling without waiting weeks for basic data coverage.
### Shipping with Ecosystems
BDS didn’t just ship APIs. We shipped _**with ecosystems**_.
In 2025, Birdeye supported builders globally through partnerships and programs, including:
 * **Startup Villages** with Superteam chapters across Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Vietnam
 * **Cypherpunk Global Hackathon** with Colosseum
 * **Base Build** , an exclusive program supporting builders on Base
 * **Orbit Earn** , offering tailored support for participating teams

These programs weren’t just about exposure. They were about giving builders reliable infrastructure they could trust while shipping real products.
### Research as Infrastructure
Data without interpretation is just noise.
In 2025, **Birdeye Research** published two flagship reports grounded in real onchain data, designed to help builders, investors, and institutions understand where crypto markets are heading:
 * **From DeFi Backbone to Payment Disruptor: How Stablecoins Evolve** Co-authored with Perena and MoonPay, exploring the growing role of stablecoins in payments and onchain finance.
 * **The Everything-Onchain Era: A RWA Spectrum Report** Co-authored with R3, with strategic support from Centrifuge and xStocks, mapping the expansion of real-world assets and tokenized financial products onchain.

### Looking Ahead: Birdeye Peak
And in 2025, we also took the first step up-market.
Announced at Breakpoint 2025, **Birdeye Peak** is our institutional market intelligence platform, designed for funds, institutions, and professional market participants.
Birdeye Peak brings structured, reliable, and actionable insights across digital asset markets, with a clear ambition: to become the **Bloomberg Terminal for crypto**.
The closed beta is now open for registration at **birdeye.so/peak**
### 2025 Built the Foundation
2025 was about laying the rails.
From trader tooling to institutional infrastructure, Birdeye Data Services is building the foundation for **Internet Capital Markets** : markets that are open, onchain, and real time by default.
2026 is about scale.

!New API: Wallet Balance Change
[](https://medium.com/@birdeye-data?source=post_page---byline--41852acd4894---------------------------------------)Birdeye Data Services (BDS) is thrilled to unveil our Wallet — Balance Change API, now available to users of Starter plan (US$99) and above.
Designed for builders who need accurate, token-level balance insights, this API offers full historical coverage from block 0, includes failed transactions, and supports granular filtering. Whether you’re building analytics dashboards, tax tools, or portfolio trackers, it delivers exactly the data you need — without the complexity of manual transaction decoding.
### Introduction to the Wallet — Balance Change API
The Wallet — Balance Change API retrieves the balance change history of any Solana wallet, with optional token-level filtering. Designed for on-chain analytics, dashboards, and monitoring tools, it offers rich query parameters to deliver the exact data you need.
_A sample response for the_ _Wallet — Balance Change API_
With this endpoint, projects can:
 * Calculate the netflow (inflow value minus outflow value) of wallets to measure the overall balance impact.
 * Monitor wallet inflows and outflows of wallets over time, broken down by specific SPL tokens or SOL, for wallet activity analysis.
 * Flag suspicious activity if there are sudden balance increases or large outflows from wallets or malicious token transfers.
 * Retrieve token-specific balance changes over a defined time window to help users or institutions calculate gains/losses in their portfolio and generate reports.

### Why Birdeye’s API leads
Our Wallet — Balance Change API provides a precise and flexible solution for tracking token-level net balance changes. Unlike other providers, it lets you query a wallet’s full balance history — from the genesis block to the present — without decoding transactions manually.
_Comparison of Birdeye Data Services’_ _Wallet — Balance Change API_ _with a similar endpoint from Solscan_

!Wallet Current Net Worth Summary: Track Real-Time Portfolio Value Across Wallets on Solana
As developers build portfolio dashboards, analytics tools, and wallet trackers, one challenge comes up often: aggregating multiple wallets’ values at once. The new **Wallet – Current Net Worth Summary (Multiple) API** from Birdeye Data Services solves that problem with a single call.
This endpoint provides an instant snapshot of total net worth for up to 100 Solana wallets, complete with the current timestamp. It’s fast, scalable, and designed for real-time portfolio tracking.
## What It Does
The Wallet – Current Net Worth Summary API returns the total net worth of multiple wallets in real time. For each wallet queried, you’ll get net worth value at the current timestamp in USD.
You can query **up to 100 wallets per request** , making it ideal for dashboards or systems that need to monitor many accounts simultaneously.
Wallet – Current Net Worth Summary is available for users on the **Business** and **Enterprise** plans.
## Pair It With Other Wallet APIs
The new summary endpoint works best when combined with:
 * **Wallet – Net Worth Chart** to visualize how portfolio value changes over time
 * **Wallet – Net Worth Details** to break down value by individual tokens within each wallet

Together, these APIs provide both high-level and granular insights, enabling developers to deliver rich, data-driven portfolio features with minimal complexity.
## Start Building
Using it is simple: send a POST request to `/wallet/v2/net-worth-summary/multiple` with up to 100 wallet addresses. The response includes real-time net worth data, timestamped and ready for use in dashboards, alerts, or portfolio views.

# Token Holder Distribution: Deep Insights Into Token Supply Concentration on Solana
Token Holder Distribution endpoint returns holder distribution statistics based on share of total supply.
3 min

!Token Holder Distribution: Deep Insights Into Token Supply Concentration on Solana
Understanding who holds a token and how supply is distributed across wallets is critical for evaluating token health, decentralization, and risk. As on-chain ecosystems mature, developers and analysts need clearer visibility into holder concentration and distribution dynamics.
To support these use cases, Birdeye Data Services is introducing a new analytics endpoint: **Token Holder Distribution**.
This API provides a structured breakdown of how a token’s supply is distributed across holders on Solana, enabling developers to build richer analytics for dashboards, token profiles, risk assessment tools, and research platforms.
## **What Token Holder Distribution Provides**
The **Token Holder Distribution** endpoint returns aggregated holder distribution statistics based on share of total supply, supporting both **percentage-based ranges** and **top holder** views.
For a given token mint address, developers can retrieve:
 * Holder distribution by specified percentage-of-supply ranges or top holders
 * Number of wallets in each specified range
 * Supply concentration insights without scanning individual holders
 * Optional wallet lists for a selected percentage range when `include_list=true`

By default, results are returned in **percent-based distribution mode**.
## **Flexible Range Filtering and Wallet Drilldowns**
To support token analytics and research workflows, **Token Holder Distribution** **API** supports both **range-based** and **top-based** holder analysis, with flexible configuration options:
 * Define custom holder segments using `min_percent` and `max_percent` for percentage-based analysis
 * Use `top` mode to retrieve distribution data for top holders by share of total supply
 * Optionally enable `include_list=true` to retrieve wallet addresses for a specified range
 * Use `offset` and `limit` parameters to paginate large holder segments efficiently

These options allow developers to quickly isolate whale segments, analyze mid-tier holder groups, or inspect long-tail ownership without scanning full holder lists.
## **How It Complements the Holder API Suite**
The new **Token Holder Distribution** API adds a supply-level view to Birdeye’s Holder Analytics, complementing existing wallet-focused holder endpoints and enabling analysis beyond individual balances.
With this release, Birdeye’s **Holder API suite** includes:
 * **Token Holder** for retrieving the top holders of a specified token
 * **Token Holder (Batch)** for retrieving token balances for a specified list of wallet owners
 * **Token Holder Distribution** for analyzing how a token’s total supply is distributed across holders by specified percentage-of-supply ranges or top holder views

Together, these APIs give developers a complete toolkit to analyze holder concentration and supply distribution, from identifying top holders and inspecting specific wallet groups to understanding overall supply structure.
## **Start Building**
Getting started is straightforward. Send a `GET` request to the **Token Holder Distribution** endpoint with a token mint address, and receive a ready-to-use breakdown of holder distribution using either percentage-based ranges or top holder views.
**Documentation:** Link
The response is optimized for direct use in dashboards, token profile pages, and analytical workflows.

!Wallet PnL Details: Full Profit and Loss Breakdown for Solana Wallets

As on-chain trading activity grows, developers need more granular and reliable ways to evaluate wallet performance. After releasing the Wallet PnL Summary API, which provides a high-level view of profitability across an entire wallet, Birdeye Data Services is expanding the suite with a deeper analytics tool: **Wallet PnL Details**.
This new endpoint returns the full PnL summary of any Solana wallet along with detailed profit and loss metrics for up to 100 individual tokens. It is ideal for dashboards, portfolio analytics, trader profiles, and research tools that require visibility beyond aggregate statistics.
## What Wallet PnL Details Provides
Wallet PnL Details builds on the summary API by including a richer view of how each token contributes to the wallet’s overall performance. For every token included, developers can retrieve:
 * Realized and unrealized PnL
 * Total cashflow
 * Buy and sell quantity
 * Last trade timestamp
 * Trade count and activity indicators

The endpoint returns both the top-level PnL summary and the token-by-token breakdown in a single call, giving developers a complete performance picture with minimal processing.
## Flexible Sorting and Filtering
To support analytics workflows, Wallet PnL Details includes customization options:
 * Sort results by `last_trade` to surface the most recently active tokens
 * Optionally filter the response by token mint address to focus on specific assets

These features help developers quickly identify active positions, dormant holdings, or tokens driving the majority of performance.
## How It Complements the PnL API Suite
The new Wallet PnL Details API replaces the now deprecated Wallet PnL (Per Token). With this release, Birdeye’s PnL toolkit now includes:
 * Wallet PnL Summary for an overall profitability snapshot
 * Wallet PnL (Per Wallet) for comparing up to 50 wallets for a single token
 * Wallet PnL Details for deep, multi-token performance breakdowns

Together, these APIs give developers the flexibility to evaluate trading performance at any scale, from individual positions to entire wallets.
## Start Building
Using Wallet PnL Details is simple. Send a POST request to `/wallet/v2/pnl/details` with a Solana wallet address. The response includes the overall summary plus detailed metrics for up to 100 tokens, ready for display in dashboards or further analysis.

!Wallet PnL Summary: Evaluate Complete Wallet Performance on Solana
Following the launch of the Wallet PnL API combo, which allows users to track realized and unrealized gains by token or by wallet, Birdeye Data Services is expanding wallet analytics with a new endpoint: Wallet PnL Summary.
This endpoint retrieves a complete overview of performance for any Solana wallet, offering a faster and simpler way to understand trading results at a glance.
## What the Summary Endpoint Delivers
Wallet PnL Summary provides a top-level snapshot of wallet performance across all tokens held. The response includes:
 * Total number of unique tokens
 * Total trades executed
 * Win rate percentage
 * Cashflow in USD
 * Realized and unrealized profit and loss

It gives a coherent performance score without the need to aggregate multiple outputs manually, helping developers build high-level analytics features more efficiently.
## How It Complements the Token and Wallet PnL APIs
The earlier Wallet PnL endpoints let you analyze performance at different depths. Wallet PnL per Token breaks down gains and losses across tokens in a wallet, while Wallet PnL per Wallet compares multiple wallets for a single token.
Wallet PnL Summary adds a higher-level perspective, showing how a wallet performs as a whole. Together, these APIs form a complete suite for performance analytics, from detailed trade-level data to portfolio-wide summaries.
## Start Using It
Using it is simple: send a GET request to `/wallet/v2/pnl/summary` with a Solana wallet address. The response includes key metrics such as total trades, unique tokens, win rate, cashflow, and PnL values, ready to display in dashboards or performance reports.

# Introducing the Wallet PnL API Combo: Track Realized & Unrealized Gains on Solana
BDS is making wallet analytics more transparent and accessible with the launch of our new Wallet PnL API combo on Solana.

!Introducing the Wallet PnL API Combo: Track Realized & Unrealized Gains on Solana
At Birdeye Data Services, we’re making wallet analytics more transparent and accessible with the launch of our new Wallet PnL API combo on Solana.
These APIs make it easy to query profit and loss (PnL) data for any Solana wallet — including trade counts, token quantities, cashflows, and both realized and unrealized PnL. This combo includes: Wallet PnL per Token and Wallet PnL per Wallet.
## What You Get from Wallet PnL
The Wallet PnL API combo goes beyond balances and snapshots. It returns detailed performance data that paints the full picture of a wallet’s trading activity, including:
 * Trade count: Total number of buy and sell transactions per token
 * Quantity: Token amounts bought, held or sold
 * Cashflow: Net inflows and outflows in USD
 * PnL: Realized and unrealized gains or losses, in both USD value and %
 * Pricing: Token prices at trade execution and current market price

## PnL per Token and per Wallet
The Wallet PnL API Combo gives you two powerful ways to analyze performance — by tokens inside a wallet, or by wallets holding a token. 
 * With Wallet PnL per Token, you can query PnL of up to 50 tokens in one wallet
 * With Wallet PnL per Wallet, you get PnL of up to 50 wallets for one token.

With these two endpoints, you can go both deep (token-level detail inside one wallet) and wide (wallet-level comparisons for one token) — giving you full flexibility for performance analytics.
## Why It Matters
PnL is one of the most requested metrics from developers building dashboards, portfolio trackers, whale trackers, and trading tools. Until now, calculating it meant stitching together trades, prices, and balances manually — a time-consuming process prone to errors.
With Wallet PnL, Birdeye does the heavy lifting. You get ready-to-use, structured PnL data, so you can focus on delivering the insights your users actually care about: who’s profitable, which tokens are driving gains or losses, and how strategies are performing in real terms.
## Start Building Today
The Wallet PnL API is now live on BDS. Combine it with our Net Worth and Wallet Token Balance APIs to deliver the most complete wallet intelligence available on Solana.

# The Most Powerful Net Worth APIs on Solana Are Here
With two new endpoints Net Worth Chart and Net Worth Details, Birdeye Data Services offers a comprehensive solution for wallet portfolio valuation in Solana.
3 min

!The Most Powerful Net Worth APIs on Solana Are Here
Wallet net worth is one of the most critical data points in any crypto app. Traders, dashboards, wallets, tax tools, and analytics platforms all rely on accurate portfolio valuation — not just totals, but token-level context and history.
With the launch of two new endpoints **Net Worth** **Chart** and **Net Worth Details** , Birdeye Data Services now offers a complete set of net worth APIs on Solana. Together with the previously launched **Current Net Worth** , these endpoints form the **Net Worth Combo** , the most comprehensive solution for wallet portfolio valuation in the ecosystem.
## Current Net Worth
The Current Net Worth endpoint answers the most immediate question: _what is this wallet worth right now?_ It returns the total USD value of a wallet along with a token-by-token breakdown, including balances and valuations.
This makes it the go-to API for powering live dashboards, wallet apps, or quick portfolio checks where users need accurate, real-time visibility.
## Net Worth Chart
While snapshots are useful, developers often need to show how a wallet has performed over time. The Net Worth Chart endpoint provides historical portfolio values, allowing you to track growth, visualize P&L, and highlight trends across any time window.
The data is immediately chart-ready, allowing you to generate historical net worth charts that visualize balance trends across any timeframe. This enables features like time-based analytics and user benchmarking, all without requiring you to piece together raw transaction data.
## Net Worth Details
For even deeper analysis, the Net Worth Details endpoint goes beyond totals and provides token-level history. You can see how individual assets contributed to a wallet’s net worth at different points in time, making it valuable for:
 * P&L attribution at the token level
 * Advanced portfolio analysis
 * Tax and compliance reporting

By tying wallet value changes to specific tokens, this endpoint makes it easy to explain _why_ a portfolio grew or declined.
## Why the Combo Matters
Separately, each of these APIs solves a critical problem. Together, they deliver the full picture of wallet net worth on Solana: a real-time snapshot, a historical timeline, and detailed token-level attribution.
For developers, that means less engineering overhead, fewer custom calculations, and a much faster path to building high-quality wallet features into your product.

# Wallet First Tx Funded API: Trace Wallet Origins on Solana
The Wallet – First Tx Funded API for Solana, will help discover the very first funding event of one or more wallets, from onboarding analysis to fraud detection
2 min 
read
!Wallet First Tx Funded API: Trace Wallet Origins on Solana
When analyzing wallets, one of the most common questions is: _When did this address first receive funds?_
Whether you’re mapping user onboarding, tracing token adoption, or flagging potentially malicious wallets, the first incoming transaction is often the key to understanding how that wallet began its journey.
That’s exactly what the new Wallet First Tx Funded API delivers.
## A New Lens on Wallet Behavior
The endpoint gives you the very first funding event for any wallet on Solana. For up to **50 wallets per request** , you’ll get the transaction hash, block time, funded amount, token address, and raw balance details.
Need to track the first time a wallet receives a specific token? Add the `**token_address**`filter, and the API will return the initial funding event for that asset only.
## Why This Matters
This isn’t just about timestamps. By pinpointing when wallets first get funded, developers can:
 * Analyze growth cohorts and track adoption curves
 * Detect newly activated wallets that may pose security risks
 * Study early token distribution patterns to uncover adoption signals

From growth teams to security researchers, the insights from this endpoint go far beyond surface-level wallet data.
## Start Building Today
Using it is simple: send a POST request to `/wallet/v2/tx/first-funded` with a list of wallet addresses (up to 50). Optionally add a token filter. The response comes back with full transaction details and funding data.

# Authentication & API Keys
To utilize the Birdeye's APIs, an API key is required for authentication. You can obtain an API key by signing up for a Birdeye.so account and generating an API key in your BDS Dashboard. Include this API key in the headers of your API requests for authentication.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to obtain an API key:
# 
1 - Create a Birdeye Account
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/authentication-api-keys#1---create-a-birdeye-account)
 * A single Birdeye account can be used for both accessing website birdeye.so and using Birdeye Data Services (BDS).
 * You can create your Birdeye account using one of two methods:
 * Using birdeye.so sign-up page: <https://birdeye.so/user/sign-up>. Please check out detailed instructions HERE.
 * Using BDS sign-up page: <https://bds.birdeye.so/auth/sign-up>. 
**Note** : Both methods above result in one single account, and that account can be used in both systems. It is not possible to create two account in those two systems with the same email address.

# 
2 - Get your API Keys
[](https://docs.birdeye.so/docs/authentication-api-keys#2---get-your-api-keys)
 * **Log in to your BDS account:** use your email and password to log into BDS Dashboard using this link: <https://bds.birdeye.so/auth/sign-in>
 * **Access the Security Tab:** On your Dashboard, look for a section labeled "Security" or similar. This is where you'll find options related to API keys and security settings.

 * **Generate API Key:** Within the Security section, you'll find an option to generate an API key. This might be labeled as "Generate Key" or something similar. Click on this option to initiate the API key generation process.

 * **Configure Key Settings (Optional):** Depending on the platform, you might have the option to configure settings for your API key. This could include specifying the access permissions or adding a name/description to the key for better organization.

 * **Generate the Key:** After configuring any optional settings, click the "Generate" or "Create" button to generate your API key. The system will create a unique API key associated with your Birdeye account.
 * **Copy the API Key:** Once the API key is generated, you'll typically see it displayed on the screen. It might be a long string of alphanumeric characters. Make sure to copy this key and keep it in a secure place. You'll need to include this key in the headers of your API requests for authentication.

And that's it! You now have your API key from Birdeye.so, which you can use to authenticate your API requests and access the services provided by the Birdeye.so APIs.
