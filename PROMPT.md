study docs/PLAN.md to understand what we're building - a Bags.fm signal aggregation bot.

study TODO.md and pick the most important thing to do - your task is to implement it, then validate that it actually works by running the verification or tests.

study reports/verify_status.json to see what gates are passing/failing - but don't just fix the first failure. think about what matters most for the goal.

study progress.txt to see what previous iterations accomplished.

IMPORTANT:
- update TODO.md when the task is done (check off the box)
- update progress.txt with what you did and the result
- you may implement missing functionality if required (but study the existing code first)
- if you need to debug, add temporary logging, check outputs, understand what's happening
- if tests are missing for what you built, add them
- if you're blocked (need API key, real data, human decision), append `<promise>NEED_HUMAN</promise>` to progress.txt
- commit when you are done
