## Historical Context (pre-Ralph)

### 2026-01-27: Project Kickoff

Created Bags.fm signal aggregation bot plan.

**Key decisions:**
- Target Bags.fm (not pump.fun) — less competition, uses Meteora DBC
- Phased approach with gates — no capital until validated
- EV-based scoring, not win rate
- Research first, then code

**Key insights:**
1. Bags uses shared infra (Meteora DBC/DAMM) — program ID alone won't work
2. Leaderboard wallets are dirty — filter deployers/snipers
3. "2x in 24h" misleading — need realistic latency simulation
4. Track exit success rate, not just entries
5. Quote-based sizing, not liquidity estimates

**Architecture (7 components):**
A: Ingestion → B: Normalizer → C: Signature decoder → D: Quote service → E: Wallet analytics → F: Strategy → G: Execution

**Stack:** Bun + TypeScript + Postgres (Neon)

### 2026-01-27: API Verification + Key Discovery

**Critical discovery — Fee Share V1 is the Bags differentiator:**
- DBC program = shared Meteora infra, used by many platforms
- Fee Share V1 (`FEEhPbKVKnco9EXnaY3i4R5rQVUx91wgVfu8qokixywi`) = Bags-specific
- Fee Share V2 appears unused

**Signature formula:**
```
Bags launch = Fee Share V1 + DBC program in same tx
```

**Token collection strategy:**
- Cannot use Bags API to list tokens (no endpoint)
- Must monitor Fee Share V1 program on-chain to discover Bags launches

### 2026-01-27: Metrics Decision

**Chose Axiom over Grafana/Prometheus:**
- No infra to manage, 500GB/month free
- Circuit breakers stay in-memory (need <10ms)
- Trade journal in Postgres (backtesting)
- Metrics/dashboards in Axiom

### 2026-01-27: Ralph Harness Setup

- Created E2E Ralph harness with component specs
- Consolidated docs: single source of truth for contract and plan
- Removed deprecated files
